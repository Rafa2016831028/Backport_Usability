<p>This is currently slated to be fixed for Seaside 2.9 but I don't know if it will even be backported to 2.8 or not.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there is already (by default) a redirection between the action and rendering phases to prevent a Refresh from re-triggering the callbacks, so in the grand scheme of things, one more redirect in this case isn't <em>so</em> bad.</p>

<p>If you still want to dig further, have a look at WARenderContinuation>>handleRequest:. That's where callback processing is triggered and the redirect or rendering phase begun.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong></p>

<p>The issue has now been fixed and (in the latest development code) you can now properly add cookies to the current response at any time. Simply access the response object in the current request context and add the cookie. For example, you might do something like:</p>

<pre><code>self requestContext response addCookie: aCookie
</code></pre>

<p>This is unlikely to be backported to Seaside 2.8 as it required a fairly major shift in the way responses are handled.</p>

<p>However, they have a <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue.qsize"" rel=""nofollow""><code>qsize</code></a> method that gives you the approximate size, for exactly this kind of purpose.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want <em>exact</em> values, you need a second <code>Queue</code> for that, where each task puts something on the out-queue, and some extra thread (or possibly the main thread) loops over it and counts up the tasks done so far. Or, alternatively, something simpler, like a global <code>int</code> counter with a global <code>Lock</code> protecting it.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, I think it would be a lot simpler to write this in terms of a pool or executor. That would take care of queueing up tasks for you, and returning a value for each one to the main thread, without you needing to manage anything.

Alfresco Community is under the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LGPL license</a>. Assuming you want to use it in-house (not distribute it to others), you can use + customise + extend Alfresco Community to your heart's content, without restriction or charge. (LGPL/GPL/etc are distribution licenses, not use licenses, so only kick in when you redistribute). However, Alfresco Community comes with no commercial support, only support provided by the community. For a lot of uses that's good enough, but for other cases you'll want to be able to ring someone for support / get hotfixes backported to your version / etc. In that case...</p>

<p>Alfresco Enterprise is paid for, coming with commercial support (including SLAs, pick up the phone and talk to an expert etc), along with a handful of features that matter in big deployments (clustering being one). Pricing depends on a few things, mostly around size of deployment and SLA, but for small deployments isn't too bad. For big deployments, it can be a huge saving over other systems! Give sales a call, they're very friendly, and only rarely buy me beer ;-)</p>

<p>If you don't want to run your own repo, there's also the <a href=""http://www.alfresco.com/products/cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">Alfresco Cloud</a> version, which comes with a <a href=""http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_API"" rel=""nofollow"">public API</a>. With this, Alfresco themselves run and maintain the instance for you, and you can use the public API to store / retrieve / manage / etc your content. It's much simpler to get going with! But you don't quite get as much control or customisation as with the on-premise versions.</p>

<p>SharePoint might already be covered by your existing Microsoft licensing deal, if you have one. If not, you'd need to decide between licensing on a per-server or per-user basis. See <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-licensing-overview-collaboration-software-FX103789438.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft pages like this</a> to get an idea of the options, then ring your Microsoft sales rep to get an idea of the pricing. In many cases, you'd need to pay someone else for support, so you'd be back to a similar thing as with Alfresco Community vs Enterprise.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what system to go with, you might be safest and best off implementing your project using <a href=""http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/cmis/trunk/cmis-v1.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">CMIS</a> (Content Management Interoperability Services).

We can get a backport for <code>enum</code> that works with Python 2.4 to 2.7 (and even 3.1 to 3.3), <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34"" rel=""noreferrer"">enum34</a> in pypi.</p>

<p>But we've managed to get along for quite some time without this new module - so why do we now have it?</p>

<p>I have a general idea about the purpose of enums from other languages. In Python, it has been common to use a bare class as follows and refer to this as an enum:</p>

<pre><code>class Colors:
    blue = 1
    green = 2
    red = 3
</code></pre>

<p>This can be used in an API to create a canonical representation of the value, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function_of_color(Colors.green)
</code></pre>

<p>If this has any criticisms, it's mutable, you can't iterate over it (easily), and how are we to know the semantics of the integer, <code>2</code>?</p>

<p>Then I suppose I could just use something like a namedtuple, which would be immutable?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Colors = namedtuple('Colors', 'blue green red')
&gt;&gt;&gt; colors = Colors('blue', 'green', 'red')
&gt;&gt;&gt; colors
Colors(blue='blue', green='green', red='red')
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(colors)
['blue', 'green', 'red']
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(colors)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; colors.blue
'blue'
&gt;&gt;&gt; colors.index(colors.blue)
0
</code></pre>

<p>The creation of the namedtuple is a little redundant (we have to write each name twice), and so somewhat inelegant. Getting the ""number"" of the color is also a little inelegant (we have to write <code>colors</code> twice). Value checking will have to be done with strings, which will be a little less efficient.</p>

<p>So back to enums.</p>

<p>What's the purpose of enums? What value do they create for the language? When should I use them and when should I avoid them?</p>

"133735","2008-09-25 14:35:35","0","","","","<p>I would definitely recommend the SimpleXML backport, as long as its performance is good enough for your needs.  The demonstrations of xml_parse look simple enough, but it can get very hairy very quickly in my experience.  The content handler functions don't get any contextual information about where the parser is in the tree, unless you track it and provide it in the start and end tag handlers.  So you're either calling functions for every start/end tag, or throwing around global variables to track where you are in the tree.</p>

<p>Obviously the SimpleXML backport will be a bit slower, as it's written in PHP and has to parse the whole document before it's available, but the ease of coding more than makes up for it.</p>

"18738694","2013-09-11 10:26:48","0","","","","<p>Based on the answer of tdelaney I created an iterator based approach. The iterator exits when the termination message is encountered. I also added a counter of how many <code>get</code>-calls are currently blocking and a <code>stop</code>-method, which sends just as many termination messages. To prevent a race condition between incrementing and reading the counter, I'm setting a stopping bit there. Furthermore I don't use <code>None</code> as the termination message, because it can not necessarily be compared to other data types when using a <code>PriorityQueue</code>.</p>

<p>There are two restrictions, that I had no need to eliminate. For one the <code>stop</code>-method first waits until the queue is empty before shutting down the threads. The second restriction is, that I did not any code to make the queue reusable after <code>stop</code>. The latter can probably be added quite easily, while the former requires being careful about concurrency and the context in which the code is used.</p>

<p>You have to decide whether you want <code>stop</code> to also wait for all the termination messages to be consumed. I choose to put the necessary <code>join</code> there, but you may just remove it.</p>

<p>So this is the code:</p>

        return ""∞""

<li>state variables No more scoping variables with an outer curly block, or the naughty my $f if 0 trick (the latter is now a syntax error). </li>
<li>defined-or No more $x = defined $y ? $y : $z, you may write $x = $y // $z instead. </li>
<li>regexp improvements Lots of work done by dave_the_m to clean up the internals, which paved the way for demerphq to add all sorts of new cool stuff. </li>
<li>smaller variable footprints Nicholas Clark worked on the implementations of SVs, AVs, HVs and other data structures to reduce their size to a point that happens to hit a sweet spot on 32-bit architectures </li>
<li>smaller constant sub footprints Nicholas Clark reduced the size of constant subs (like use constant FOO => 2). The result when loading a module like POSIX is significant. </li>
<li>stacked filetests you can now say if  (-e -f -x $file). Perl 6 was supposed to allow this, but they moved in a different direction. Oh well. </li>
<li>lexical $_ allows you to nest $_ (without using local). </li>
<li>_ prototype you can now declare a sub with prototype <em>. If called with no arguments, gets fed with $</em> (allows you to replace builtins more cleanly). </li>
<li>x operator on a list you can now say my @arr = qw(x y z) x 4. (Update: this feature was backported to the 5.8 codebase after having been implemented in blead, which is how Somni notices that it is available in 5.8.8). </li>
<li>switch a true switch/given construct, inspired by Perl 6 </li>
<li>smart match operator (~~) to go with the switch </li>
<li>closure improvements dave_the_m thoroughly revamped the closure handling code to fix a number of buggy behaviours and memory leaks. </li>
<li>faster Unicode lc, uc and /i are faster on Unicode strings. Improvements to the UTF-8 cache. </li>
<li>improved sorts inplace sorts performed when possible, rather than using a temporary. Sort functions can be called recursively: you can sort a tree </li>
<li>map in void context is no longer evil. Only morally. </li>
<li>less opcodes used in the creation of anonymous lists and hashes. Faster pussycat! </li>
<li>tainting improvements More things that could be tainted are marked as such (such as sprintf formats) </li>
<li>$# and $* removed Less action at a distance </li>
<li>perlcc and JPL removed These things were just bug magnets, and no-one cared enough about them. </li>

"56508200","2019-06-08 16:29:40","38","","","","<p>Parsing a string with date and time into a particular point in time (Java calls it an  &quot;<a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Instant</code></a>&quot;) is quite complicated. Java has been tackling this in several iterations. The latest one, <code>java.time</code> and <code>java.time.chrono</code>, covers almost all needs (except <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time dilation</a> :) ).</p>
<p>However, that complexity brings a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>The key to understand date parsing is:</p>
<h2>Why does Java have so many ways to parse a date?</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are several systems to measure a time. For instance, the historical Japanese calendars were derived from the time ranges of the reign of the respective emperor or dynasty. Then there is, e.g., the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unix timestamp</a>.
Fortunately, the whole (business) world managed to use the same.</li>
<li>Historically, the systems were being switched from/to, for <a href=""https://www.history.com/news/6-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-gregorian-calendar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">various reasons</a>. E.g., from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Julian calendar</a> to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gregorian calendar</a> in 1582; so, the 'western' dates before that need to be treated differently.</li>
<li>And, of course, the change did not happen at once. Because the calendar came from the headquarters of some religion and other parts of Europe believed in other deities, for instance Germany did not switch until the year 1700.</li>
</ol>
<h2>...and why is the <code>LocalDateTime</code>, <code>ZonedDateTime</code> et al. so complicated</h2>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>There are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time zones</a>.
A time zone is basically a &quot;stripe&quot;*<strong>[3]</strong> of the Earth's surface whose authorities follow the same rules of when does it have which time offset. This includes summer time rules.</p>
<p>The time zones change over time for various areas, mostly based on who conquers whom. And one time zone's rules <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Standard_Time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">change over time</a> as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are time offsets. That is not the same as time zones, because a time zone may be, e.g., &quot;Prague&quot;, but that has summer time offset and winter time offset.</p>
<p>If you get a timestamp with a time zone, the offset may vary, depending on what part of the year it is in. During the leap hour, the timestamp may mean two different times, so without additional information, it can't be reliably converted.</p>
<p>Note: By <em>timestamp</em> I mean &quot;a string that contains a date and/or time, optionally with a time zone and/or time offset.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several time zones may share the same time offset for certain periods. For instance, the GMT/UTC time zone is the same as the &quot;London&quot; time zone when the summer time offset is not in effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To make it a bit more complicated (but that's not too important for your use case):</p>
<ol start=""7"">
<li><p>The scientists observe Earth's dynamic, which changes over time; based on that, they add seconds at the end of individual years. (So <em>2040-12-31 24:00:00</em> may be a valid date-time.) This needs regular updates of the metadata that systems use to have the date conversions right. E.g., on Linux, you get regular updates to the Java packages including these new data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The updates do not always keep the previous behavior for both historical and future timestamps. So it may happen that parsing of the two timestamps around some time zone's change comparing them <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-times-in-1927-giving-a-strange-result"">may give different results</a> when running on different versions of the software. That also applies to comparing between the affected time zone and other time zone.</p>
<p>Should this cause a bug in your software, consider using some timestamp that does not have such complicated rules, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unix timestamp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because of 7, for the future dates, we can't convert dates exactly with certainty. So, for instance, current parsing of <em>8524-02-17 12:00:00</em> may be off a couple of seconds from the future parsing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>JDK's APIs for this evolved with the contemporary needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>The early Java releases had just <code>java.util.Date</code> which had a bit naive approach, assuming that there's just the year, month, day, and time. This quickly did not suffice.</li>
<li>Also, the needs of the databases were different, so quite early, <code>java.sql.Date</code> was introduced, with its own limitations.</li>
<li>Because neither covered different calendars and time zones well, the <code>Calendar</code> API was introduced.</li>
<li>This still did not cover the complexity of the time zones. And yet, the mix of the above APIs was really a pain to work with. So as Java developers started working on global web applications, libraries that targeted most use cases, like JodaTime, got quickly popular. JodaTime was the de facto standard for about a decade.</li>
<li>But the JDK did not integrate with JodaTime, so working with it was a bit cumbersome. So, after a very long discussion on how to approach the matter, <a href=""https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSR-310</a> was created <a href=""https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-983209"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mainly based on JodaTime</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to deal with it in Java's <code>java.time</code></h2>
<h3>Determine what type to parse a timestamp to</h3>
<p>When you are consuming a timestamp string, you need to know what information it contains. <strong>This is the crucial point.</strong> If you don't get this right, you end up with a cryptic exceptions like &quot;Can't create Instant&quot;, &quot;Zone offset missing&quot;, &quot;unknown zone id&quot;, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Does it contain the date and the time?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Does it have a time offset?</strong>
A time offset is the <em>+hh:mm</em> part. Sometimes, <em>+00:00</em> may be substituted with <em>Z</em> as 'Zulu time', <code>UTC</code> as Universal Time Coordinated, or <em>GMT</em> as Greenwich Mean Time. These also set the time zone.
For these timestamps, you use <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>OffsetDateTime</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Does it have a time zone?</strong>
For these timestamps, you use <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ZonedDateTime</code></a>.
Zone is specified either by</p>
<ul>
<li>name (&quot;Prague&quot;, &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;, &quot;PST&quot;), or</li>
<li>&quot;zone ID&quot; (&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;, &quot;Europe/London&quot;), represented by <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">java.time.ZoneId</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of time zones is compiled by a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;TZ database&quot;</a>, backed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ICAAN</a>.</p>
<p>According to <code>ZoneId</code>'s javadoc, the zone id's can also somehow be specified as <em>Z</em> and offset. I'm not sure how this maps to real zones.</p>
<p>If the timestamp, which only has a TZ, falls into a leap hour of time offset change, then it is ambiguous, and the interpretation is subject of <code>ResolverStyle</code>, see below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If it has neither</strong>, then the missing context is assumed or neglected. And the consumer has to decide. So it needs to be parsed as <code>LocalDateTime</code> and converted to <code>OffsetDateTime</code> by adding the missing info:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>assume</em> that it is a UTC time. Add the UTC offset of 0 hours.</li>
<li>You can <em>assume</em> that it is a time of the place where the conversion is happening. Convert it by adding the system's time zone.</li>
<li>You can <em>neglect</em> and just use it as is. That is useful e.g. to compare or subtract two times (see <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Duration</code></a>), or when you don't know and it doesn't really matter (e.g., local bus schedule).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Partial time information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on what the timestamp contains, you can take <code>LocalDate</code>, <code>LocalTime</code>, <code>OffsetTime</code>, <code>MonthDay</code>, <code>Year</code>, or <code>YearMonth</code> out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the full information, you can get a <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>java.time.Instant</code></a>. This is also internally used to convert between <code>OffsetDateTime</code> and <code>ZonedDateTime</code>.</p>
<h3>Figure out how to parse it</h3>
<p>There is an extensive documentation on <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>DateTimeFormatter</code></a> which can both parse a timestamp string and format to string.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#predefined"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pre-created <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>s</a> should cover more or less all standard timestamp formats. For instance, <code>ISO_INSTANT</code> can parse <code>2011-12-03T10:15:30.123457Z</code>.</p>
<p>If you have some special format, then you can <a href=""https://www.baeldung.com/java-datetimeformatter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">create your own DateTimeFormatter</a> (which is also a parser).</p>
<pre><code>private static final DateTimeFormatter TIMESTAMP_PARSER = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()
   .parseCaseInsensitive()
   .append(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SX&quot;))
   .toFormatter();
</code></pre>
<p>I recommend to look at the source code of <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> and get inspired on how to build one using <code>DateTimeFormatterBuilder</code>. While you're there, also have a look at <code>ResolverStyle</code> which controls whether the parser is LENIENT, SMART or STRICT for the formats and ambiguous information.</p>
<h3>TemporalAccessor</h3>
<p>Now, the frequent mistake is to go into the complexity of <code>TemporalAccessor</code>. This comes from how the developers were used to work with <code>SimpleDateFormatter.parse(String)</code>. Right, <code>DateTimeFormatter.parse(&quot;...&quot;)</code> gives you <code>TemporalAccessor</code>.</p>
<pre><code>// No need for this!
TemporalAccessor ta = TIMESTAMP_PARSER.parse(&quot;2011-... etc&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>But, equipped with the knowledge from the previous section, you can conveniently parse into the type you need:</p>
<pre><code>OffsetDateTime myTimestamp = OffsetDateTime.parse(&quot;2011-12-03T10:15:30.123457Z&quot;, TIMESTAMP_PARSER);
</code></pre>
<p>You do not actually need to the <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> either. The types you want to parse have the <code>parse(String)</code> methods.</p>
<pre><code>OffsetDateTime myTimestamp = OffsetDateTime.parse(&quot;2011-12-03T10:15:30.123457Z&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Regarding <code>TemporalAccessor</code>, you can use it if you have a vague idea of what information there is in the string, and want to decide at runtime.</p>
<p>I hope I shed some light of understanding onto your soul :)</p>
<p>Note: There's a backport of <code>java.time</code> to Java 6 and 7: <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen-Backport</a>. For Android it has <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[3]</strong> Not just that they are not stripes, but there also some weird extremes. For instance, some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#/media/File:Solar_time_vs_standard_time.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neighboring Pacific Islands</a> have +14:00 and -11:00 time zones. That means, that while on one island, there is 1st May 3 PM, on another island not so far, it is still 30 April 12 PM (if I counted correctly :) )</p>

"37684706","2016-06-07 16:32:54","18","","","","<p>If you want <code>Point</code> as a separate entity from the <code>Enum</code> that tracks the corners, then you need them to be separate:</p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum

class Point(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def __repr__(self):

class Corner(Enum):
    BottomLeft = Point(0, 0)
    TopLeft = Point(0, 100)
    TopRight = Point(100, 100)
    BottmRight = Point(100, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Doing it this way means that each <code>enum</code> contains a <code>Point</code> as its value, but is not a <code>Point</code> itself:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.BottomLeft
&lt;Corner.BottomLeft: Point(0, 0)&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.BottomLeft.value
Point(0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the <code>enum</code> members to <em>be</em> a <code>Point</code>, then mix in the <code>Point</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum

class Point(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Point(%r, %r)' % (self.x, self.y)

class Corner(Point, Enum):
    BottomLeft = 0, 0
    TopLeft = 0, 100
    TopRight = 100, 100
    BottmRight = 100, 0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft
&lt;Corner.TopLeft: (0, 0)&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(Corner.TopLeft, Point)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.value
(0, 100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.x
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.y
100
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if all you need is for the <code>enum</code>s to have the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes:</p>

<pre><code>from aenum import Enum

class Corner(Enum):
    __init__ = 'x y'
    BottomLeft = 0, 0
    TopLeft = 0, 100
    TopRight = 100, 100
    BottmRight = 100, 0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft
&lt;Corner.TopLeft: (0, 100)&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.value
(0, 100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.x
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; Corner.TopLeft.y
100

You can accomplish the same thing with either <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>enum34</code></a> or the stdlib <code>enum</code> by writing an <code>__init__</code> for the <code>Point</code> class.</p>

<p>However there is still one good reason to prefer the array version, in some cases at least. CharBuffer was only introduced in Java 1.4 so if you are deploying to an earlier version you <em>can't</em> use Charbuffer (unless you roll-your-own/use a backport).</p>

"56562480","2019-06-12 12:40:37","1","","","","<p>It’s not really clear whether a localized date format is rather tied to language or to country. It seems to me to be most often tied to language or to a combination of both. So when you are asking for a short date format for a locale without language (a country only), you will very often get <code>y-MM-dd</code>, which is the worldwide default short date format.</p>

<p>My Java 11 has 6 (six) available locales for the United States, and they tend to give different short date formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>lkt_US</code> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lakota</a>, a Sioux language) gives <code>y-MM-dd</code> (the worldwide default)</li>
<li><code>es_US</code> (Spanish) and <code>haw_US</code> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hawaiian</a>) give <code>d/M/yy</code></li>
<li><code>en_US_POSIX</code>, <code>en_US</code> and <code>chr_US</code> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cherokee</a>) give <code>M/d/yy</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So I suppose all of the above would be correct answers for a short US date format. And I trust that the code in your own answer will give you one of them. The real question is which one of them you want. Or your user.</p>

<h2>java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>Now that I am writing an answer, I want to mention that <code>DateFormat</code> and <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> are notoriously troublesome and long outdated. Instead consider using <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> and/or <code>DateTimeFormatterBuilder</code> from java.time, the modern Java date and time API.</p>

<pre><code>    Locale usSpanish = Locale.forLanguageTag(""es-US"");
    String dateFormatPattern = DateTimeFormatterBuilder.getLocalizedDateTimePattern(
            FormatStyle.SHORT, null, IsoChronology.INSTANCE, usSpanish);
    System.out.println(""Format pattern: "" + dateFormatPattern);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Format pattern: M/d/yy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve run this snippet on Java 7 using ThreeTen Backport, the backport of java.time. And the format pattern isn’t the same as the one I got from Java 11 above. Java 7 is using Java’s built-in locale data, while Java 11 uses CLDR, Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. There are differences between the two. I don’t know what Android uses, but I trust that it’s something sensible.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

"18927577","2013-09-21 00:10:20","4","","","","<p>Firstly, I have just released a library called <a href=""https://github.com/michalmarczyk/avl.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">avl.clj</a> which implements persistent sorted maps and sets with support for the standard Clojure API (they are drop-in replacements for the built-in sorted collections), as well as transients and logarithmic time rank queries (via <code>clojure.core/nth</code>)<sup>1</sup>. Both Clojure and ClojureScript are supported; performance on the Clojure side is mostly on a par with the built-in variants in my preliminary benchmarking. Follow the link above if you'd like to give it a try. Any experience reports would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>As for the actual question: I'm afraid there isn't much in the way of documentation on Clojure's internal interfaces, but still, implementing them is the only way of making one's custom data structures fit in with the built-ins. <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.rrb-vector"" rel=""nofollow"">core.rrb-vector</a> (which I have written and now maintain) takes this approach, as do other Contrib libraries implementing various data structures. This is also what I've done with avl.clj, as well as <a href=""https://github.com/michalmarczyk/sorted.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">sorted.clj</a> (which is basically the ClojureScript port of the red-black-tree-based sorted collections backported to Clojure). All of these libraries, as well as Clojure's own <code>gvec.clj</code> file which implements the primitive-storing vectors produced by <code>clojure.core/vector-of</code>, can serve as examples of what's involved. (Though I have to say it's easy to miss a method here and there...)</p>

<p>The situation is much simpler in ClojureScript, where all the core protocols are defined at the top of <code>core.cljs</code>, so you can just look at the list and pick the ones relevant to your data structure. Hopefully the same will be true on the Clojure side one day.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Removal by rank is <code>(disj my-set (nth my-set 123))</code> for now. I might provide a direct implementation later on if it turns out to make enough of a difference performance-wise. (I'll definitely write one to check if it does.)</p>

"18972104","2013-09-24 02:39:49","6","","","","<p>Here's a way:</p>

<pre><code>xs = []
n = 0

class A:
    def __del__(self):
        global n
        n += 1
        print(""time {} calling __del__"".format(n))
        xs.append(self)

print(""creating an A immediately thrown away"")
A()
for _ in range(5):
    print(""popping from xs"")
    xs.pop()
</code></pre>

<p>That prints:</p>

<pre><code>creating an A immediately thrown away
time 1 calling __del__
popping from xs
time 2 calling __del__
popping from xs
time 3 calling __del__
popping from xs
time 4 calling __del__
popping from xs
time 5 calling __del__
popping from xs
time 6 calling __del__
</code></pre>

<p>So, in short, there's no limit on how many times <code>__del__</code> can be called.  But don't rely on this - the language may change ""the rules"" here eventually.</p>

<p>Cycles complicate the situation because when a cycle is entirely trash, there's no predictable order in which the objects belonging to the cycle will get destroyed.  Since it <strong>is</strong> a cycle, every object is reachable from every other object in the cycle, so executing a <code>__del__</code> for one of the objects in the cycle <strong>may</strong> reference an object that's already been destroyed.  Major headaches there, so CPython simply refuses to collect a cycle at least one of whose objects has a <code>__del__</code> method.</p>

<p>However, it's no problem if an object ""hanging off"" a trash cycle has a <code>__del__</code> method, provided the latter object is not itself in a trash cycle.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>class A:
    def __del__(self):
        print(""A is going away"")

class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self.self = self
        self.a = A()
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; import gc
&gt;&gt;&gt; gc.collect()  # nothing happens
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = None  # now c is in a trash self-cycle
&gt;&gt;&gt; gc.collect()  # c.a.__del__ *is* called
A is going away
2
</code></pre>

<p>So that's the moral of this story:  if you have an object that ""needs"" to run a destructor, but may be in a cycle, put the <code>__del__</code> in a simple object <strong>referenced by</strong> the original object.  Like so:</p>

<pre><code>class CriticalResource:
    def __init__(self, resource):
        self.r = resource

    def __del__(self):
        self.r.close_nicely()  # whatever

class FancyObject:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.r = CriticalResource(get_some_resource())
        # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now a <code>FancyObject</code> can be in as many cycles as you like.  When it becomes trash, the cycles won't prevent <code>CriticalResource</code>'s <code>__del__</code> from being invoked.</p>

<h2>Starting in Python 3.4</h2>

<p>As @delnan noted in a comment, <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0442/"">PEP 442 changes the CPython rules</a> starting in Python 3.4 (but this will not be backported to any previous CPython release).  <code>__del__</code> methods will be executed at most once then (by gc - of course users can explicitly call them any number of times), and it will no longer matter whether an object with a <code>__del__</code> method is part of cyclic trash.</p>

<p>The implementation will run all finalizers on all objects found in cyclic trash, and set a bit on each such object recording that its finalizer has been run.  It does this before any objects are torn down, so no finalizer can access an object in an insane (partially or wholly destructed) state.</p>

<p>The downside for the implementation is that finalizers can change the object graph in arbitrary ways, so the current cyclic garbage collection (""gc"") run has to give up if anything in the cyclic trash has become reachable again (""resurrected"").  That's why finalizers are (will be) allowed to run at most once:  else gc could be provoked into never making progress by a finalizer that resurrected dead objects in cyclic trash.</p>

<p>In effect, starting in 3.4, CPython's treatment of <code>__del__</code> methods will be a lot like Java's treatment of finalizers.</p>

"56655969","2019-06-18 19:39:14","1","","","","<p>First of all, such functionality already exists. 
Spring Boot integrates with Micrometer framework that allows this type of behavior (Spring Boot 1.x uses dropwizard metrics with an optional micrometer backport support both allow this declarative style of annotations).</p>

<p><a href=""https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_the_timed_annotation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is a relevant chapter of micrometer documentation.</p>

<p>By far its the best option I know, however if you still prefer to do your own (the reason can be that all these metering frameworks maintain some mathematical model (with sliding window and everything) around the metrics, and if you want something that more resembles profiling for debugging purposes or something, then you might consider doing your own stuff).</p>

<p>Now a word about Spring AOP suggested by other answers. I (and this is only my opinion) think that using bean post processors has its advantage over AOP in this case.
First of all, maybe you don't use spring AOP at all, only plain spring.
The second reason to opt for this style of implementation is the performance, AOP adds quite a lot of calls to the Stack.
The obvious advantage of AOP is the simlicity of implementation.</p>

<p>So, let's assume you do want a BPP way:</p>

<p>I think first of all you should check that the Bean Post Processor gets ""recognized"" by spring during the application start-up.</p>

<p>In order to check this, you can create a no-arg consructor in BPP and print something like ""Hello from BPP"" there or use the debugger.</p>

<p>Now, regarding the suggested implementation:
You need to iterate over the methods and create a proxy only once. There is no point of creating proxy over proxy over proxy.... So the presented code is wrong.</p>

<p>I think you should iterate over methods, prepare a list of methods and memorize this set, then create a proxy that will have an <code>invoke</code> method that will check whether the method is in the set of methods and if so do the proxy magic, otherwise just delegate the call to the underlying bean. </p>

<p>Two things you should keep in mind when you go this way:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Proxy won't work with real classes, only with the interface. If you have a class and do not work by the interface you'll need to fiddle with CGLIB</p></li>
<li><p>Other bean postprocessors can also wrap your bean in some kind of proxy, for example, what if you measure a method annotated with <code>@Transactional</code>? </p></li>

  <p>What's the problem?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gross problem list includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are using the poorly designed and long outdated Java date and time classes <code>Date</code>, <code>TimeZone</code> and <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>.</li>
<li>You are using the deprecated methods <code>getMonth</code>, <code>getDate</code> and <code>getYear</code> of the <code>Date</code> class. These methods work unreliably across time zone, which is the main reason why they were deprecated.</li>
<li>You are doing the time zone conversion manually using addition, subtraction and multiplication. Date and time math is error-prone, and you should always leave it to proven library methods.</li>
<li>The millisecond count you get from <code>Date.getTime</code> is since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC. This is a unique moment in time and independent of time zone, so adding to and subtracting from the millisecond count for time zone conversion makes no sense.</li>
<li>I can reproduce your result when I set my JVM’s default time zone to Asia/Seoul and assume that <code>HOUR</code> is 0 (or some value in the range from 0 through 111). I assume that you had wanted <code>HOUR</code> to denote the number of milliseconds in an hour, 3 600 000 (at least usually, exceptions exist).</li>
<li>You were formatting your date by concatenating the results of calls to <code>Strirg.format</code>. It’s better to leave formatting to a specialized date formatter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The fix: java.time</h2>

<pre><code>    ZoneId serverTimeZone = ZoneId.of(""Asia/Seoul"");
    DateTimeFormatter serverFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");
    ZoneId clientTimeZone = ZoneId.systemDefault();

    String checkedDate = ""2019-06-24 16:15:31"";
    ZonedDateTime serverDateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(checkedDate, serverFormatter)
            .atZone(serverTimeZone);
    ZonedDateTime clientDateTime = serverDateTime.withZoneSameInstant(clientTimeZone);
    System.out.println(""clientDateTime: "" + clientDateTime);
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry that I can write and run only Java code, I trust you to translate. With my JVM’s time zone still set to Asia/Seoul I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>clientDateTime: 2019-06-24T16:15:31+09:00[Asia/Seoul]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The server time and the client time are the same, as you requested. If instead I keep my own time zone, I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>clientDateTime: 2019-06-24T09:15:31+02:00[Europe/Copenhagen]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there is a conversion taking place.</p>

<p>To format the date:</p>

<pre><code>    DateTimeFormatter displayFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(FormatStyle.MEDIUM)
            .withLocale(Locale.forLanguageTag(""ko-KR""));
    String transformedLocalDate = clientDateTime.format(displayFormatter);
    System.out.println(""transformedLocalDate: "" + transformedLocalDate);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>transformedLocalDate: 2019. 6. 24.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or if you insist on month.date.year:</p>

<pre><code>    DateTimeFormatter displayFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""MM.dd.u"");
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>transformedLocalDate: 06.24.2019</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A further recommendation would be to have your server deliver a date-time string in UTC in ISO 8601 format. That would go like <code>2019-06-24T07:15:31Z</code> for the moment used in the examples.</p>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Python 2.x importer doesn't show you <em>which</em> problem it's actually hit; all you can tell is that, for some reason, the call to open the shared library failed.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that in 3.1 or later, you would have gotten a much more useful error message, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/python3.3/dist-packages/guppy/heapy/heapyc.so, 2): no suitable image found.  Did find:
    /usr/local/lib/python3.3/dist-packages/guppy/heapy/heapyc.so: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>However, that's only possible because the importer was rewritten from scratch for 3.1, and there's no way such a radical change is ever going to be backported to 2.7.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most platforms come with tools that let you test shared libraries, and this is really the best way to diagnose the problem.</p>

<p>But for a simple and platform-independent test, you can just use the <code>ctypes</code> library that comes with Python itself:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ctypes
&gt;&gt;&gt; ctypes.CDLL('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/guppy/heapy/heapyc.so')
</code></pre>

<p>You should get an error, like this:</p>

<pre><code>OSError: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/guppy/heapy/heapyc.so: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the file isn't readable (or, on platforms that require shared libraries to be executable, it either isn't readable or isn't executable), which should be enough to fix the problem. So, a <code>chmod a+r</code> should fix it (although you may want to go further and figure out why it wasn't readable in the first place).</p>

<p>If the error doesn't tell you enough to fix it yourself, and searching doesn't help, at least you can come to SO and ask a question that will be much more likely to get an immediate answer…</p>

"19129530","2013-10-02 03:26:40","10","","","","<p>@Luksprog basically already answered this in the first on your question, but here's some more documentation to further support that claim.</p>

<p>First, read the the javadoc for <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/ActivityCompat.html#startActivity%28android.app.Activity,%20android.content.Intent,%20android.os.Bundle%29""><code>ActivityCompat#startActivity(Activity activity, Intent intent, Bundle options)</code></a> <em>carefully</em>. I've highlighted some relevant keywords:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start an activity with additional launch information, <strong>if able</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>In Android 4.1+ additional options were introduced to allow for more
  control on activity launch animations. Applications can use this
  method along with ActivityOptionsCompat to use these animations when
  available. <strong>When run on versions of the platform where this feature
  does not exist the activity will be launched normally</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that basically tells us that the (optional) animations feature will only work on versions of Android that natively support it. On all other platform versions, the <code>Activity</code> will be launched 'normally' - that is, without the optional animation.</p>

<p>The actual proof can easily be found in the <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r2.1/android/support/v4/app/ActivityCompat.java#86"">source code of <code>ActivityCompat</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>public static void startActivity(Activity activity, Intent intent, Bundle options) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= 16) {
        ActivityCompatJB.startActivity(activity, intent, options);
    } else {
        activity.startActivity(intent);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In other words: if this code is executed on a pre-JB device, a plain old <code>startActivity()</code> call will be mad, where the <code>options</code> parameter gets ignored. Only JB devices will end up using that.</p>

<p>Perhaps redundant to mention, but obviously the same applies to the <code>startActivityForResult()</code> counterpart.</p>

<p>To summarize: Currently the Support Library simply offers a static helper class to execute certain functionality in <em>""a backwards compatible fashion""</em> - it doesn't actually backport that functionality (yet). All it does at this stage is save you having to write the <code>if/else</code> condition in your own app. </p>

<p>That being said, the current implementation does allow for a future backport of the actual functionality. That's possibly also why the <code>ActivityOptionsCompat</code> class exists. Right now the class provides an 'empty' implementation for pre-JB devices, which, in theory, could be 'filled' at a later stage. Any code calling through these compatibility helpers will then automagically start working.</p>

<p><a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r2.1/android/support/v4/app/ActivityOptionsCompat.java#43"">Example of an <code>ActivityOptionsCompat</code> call</a> returning an empty implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public static ActivityOptionsCompat makeCustomAnimation(Context context,
        int enterResId, int exitResId) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= 16) {
        return new ActivityOptionsImplJB(
            ActivityOptionsCompatJB.makeCustomAnimation(context, enterResId, exitResId));
    }
    return new ActivityOptionsCompat();
}

<p>Satisfied for the work done I merge the patch into <code>m5</code> but I am asked to backport the patch to <code>release</code> and produce an update.</p>

<p>Okay, but <code>patch</code> is a series of commit. I think I should rebase.</p>

<p>The problem is that rebasing <code>patch</code> onto <code>release</code> involves a commit, <code>m3</code>, which must not be part of the <code>release</code> branch. It could be an entire series of commits.</p>

<p>So the scenario is the following. I know that <code>feature</code> was <strong>generated</strong> from a specific commit (normally a tag in our workflow), so I would like to rebase all commits from <code>m4</code> (excluded) to <code>patch</code> included, pointing <code>release</code> to the new <code>P3'</code>.</p>

<p>I have tried to <em>abuse</em> <code>onto</code> option of rebase command, so I am asking advice here because I might have not enough understandment of the rebase command</p>

<pre><code>git checkout release #pick r4
git branch experiment #destructive actions will try not to destroy precious branches
git checkout experiment
git rebase --onto experiment m4 patch # detaches head, but I don't want that!

"19189456","2013-10-04 19:39:30","3","","","","<p>This is a long and detailed answer, but here goes the point. Qt 5.2 has an example how you could achieve all this with Qt based on the ""SaveGame"" example which is also doing the serialization and deserialization. It is basically doing that for the non-playable game character. It is also using <code>QSaveFile</code> for saving the information safely into the desired file. Here you can find the url to the documentation of the example for your convenience:</p>

<p><a href=""http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qdoc/qtcore-savegame-example.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qdoc/qtcore-savegame-example.html</a></p>

<p>I have just solved this issue a few days ago with Qt5's json parser. I would suggest to take a look into the following classes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>QJsonDocument</code>: <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsondocument.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsondocument.html</a></li>
<li><code>QJsonObject</code>: <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonobject.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonobject.html</a></li>
<li><code>QJsonArray</code>: <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonarray.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonarray.html</a></li>
<li><code>QJsonParseError</code>: <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonparseerror.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonparseerror.html</a></li>
<li><code>QJsonValue</code>: <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonvalue.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qjsonvalue.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are planning to use Qt 4, you will need to use the <code>QJson</code> library for instance, but mind you, it is a lot slower than the Qt 5 json parser based on the performance. Here you can find Thiago's benchmark:</p>

<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/108138837678270193032/posts/7EVTACgwtxK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/108138837678270193032/posts/7EVTACgwtxK</a></p>

<p>The json format supports strings, integers, and bool just as you wish, so that should work for you. Here you can find the signatures how to serialize and deserialize such types:</p>

<h3>Serialize</h3>

<pre><code>bool    toBool(bool defaultValue = false) const
double  toDouble(double defaultValue = 0) const
QString toString(const QString &amp; defaultValue = QString()) const
</code></pre>

<h3>Deserialize</h3>

<pre><code>QJsonValue(bool b)
QJsonValue(double n)
QJsonValue(const QString &amp; s)
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can find a summary page about the json support in Qt 5:</p>

<p><a href=""http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt5-nosubdir/json.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt5-nosubdir/json.html</a></p>

<p>Note that, Qt 5's json is saved internally as a very efficient binary representation, so essentially you could also use that rather than text representation. It depends on your exact scenario. Actually, for Qt 4, you could even backport these classes if needed since they are so much tied to Qt 5. It may have actually been so for BlackBerry development since we were struggling with Qt 4 there, and we badly needed the json parser from Qt.</p>

<p>This is very strange because I didn't use the <code>plotly_build</code> function, and because the only item which is not displayed is a formattable.

<p>With the state of system updates being so slow, I was thinking of using a more reactive or up-to-date repository for Apache httpd. This is out of security concerns (<a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html</a>).</p>

<p>I came across SCL months ago but despite hours and hours of documentation reading and web browsing, I haven't yet found a way to have httpd24-http from SCL replace the standard httpd package, in the same way that mariadb packages are a drop-in replacement for mysql packages.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to do without httpd from the default repository and instead have httpd24-httpd from SCL and how?</strong></p>

<p>The thing that has me asking this question is that some packages (e.g. phpMyAdmin and roundcubemail) seem to not see the package from SCL and pull in httpd, which gets installed as a dependency.</p>

<p>I am still somehow confused as to whether Apache httpd (2.4.39 atm) from the SCL is a replacement or whether it's supposed to be installed alongside httpd (2.4.6 atm), in which case, I am wondering whether there is much use since both programs will try to bind to port 80 and port 443. I'm surely missing a few key points in understanding the SCL ecosystem, specifically concerning httpd or similar daemons.</p>

<p>EDIT
I finally understood that the SCL version is to be installed alongside the standard httpd. Also, the standard http receives security backports, which answers my initial need.</p>

It was a tradeoff for compatibility.  We've since lost that compatibility<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22610400/a-program-made-with-java-8-can-be-run-on-java-7"">[1]</a> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22572230/are-compiled-java-8-lambda-expressions-backwards-compatible-with-earlier-version"">[2]</a> [3]--bytecode can be run on later versions of the JVM but not earlier ones.  This looks like the worse possible choice: we've lost type information and we still can't run bytecode compiled for newer versions of the JVM on older versions.  What happened?</p>

<p>Specifically I'm asking if there are any technical reasons why type erasure couldn't be removed in the next version of the JVM (assuming, like previous releases, its bytecode won't be able to run on the last version anyway).</p>

<p>[3]: Type erasure could be backported in a manner similar to <a href=""https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda"" rel=""noreferrer"">retrolambda</a> for those who really like it.</p>

<p>Edit: I think the discussion of the definition of backwards vs. forwards compatibility is obscuring the question.</p>

<p>Also see if instead of <code>Date</code> objects you can fill <code>LocalDate</code> or <code>MonthDay</code> objects into your list. A <code>Date</code> despite the class name doesn’t represent a date, and the class is poorly designed and long outdated. <code>LocalDate</code> and <code>MonthDay</code> are classes from java.time, the modern Java date and time API, which is much nicer to work with than the old classes like <code>Date</code>.</p>
<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>
<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

We only need to implement the IR transmitter function.</p>

<p>For only the transmitter, the custom driver need only control the RTS pin on <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>, <em>from within the module.</em></p>

<p>On standard hardware, the driver loads:</p>

<pre><code>00:05: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NEW APPROACH</strong></p>

<p>I have not figured out how to deactivate the current driver for the serial port, so rather than create a new driver, how would you use the current <em>8250-dw</em> driver to change the RTS pin on behalf of my kernel module? Something like this?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WRHFm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WRHFm.jpg"" alt=""Driver stack""></a></p>

<p>Using line disciplines per this article on the slip driver looked promising, Just take <em>slip.c</em> and remove the network side of the code. But it needs a user space program (<code>slattach</code> or <code>dip</code>) to open <em>/dev/ttyS0</em> and activate the line discipline. </p>

<p>Is that possible (or a good idea) from within a kernel module?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqmJF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqmJF.png"" alt=""From https://www.linux.it/~rubini/docs/serial/serial.html""></a></p>

<p>In this similar question, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51045615/how-do-i-open-write-read-a-uart-device-from-a-kernel-module"">How do I open/write/read a uart device from a kernel module?</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/5264491/ian-abbott"">Ian Abbott</a> suggested backporting serdev to kernel 4.9. </p>

<p>That's getting a bit involved and we're already behind schedule.  Is there an easier way?</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>However, the embedded board (based on the <a href=""https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/78475/intel-atom-processor-e3845-2m-cache-1-91-ghz.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BayTrail Atom E3845</a>) has the serial port controller in memory mapped I/O:</p>

<pre><code>80860F0A:00: ttyS0 at MMIO 0x90a0c000 (irq = 39, base_baud = 2764800) is a 16550A
80860F0A:01: ttyS1 at MMIO 0x90a0e000 (irq = 40, base_baud = 2764800) is a 16550A
</code></pre>

<p>I'm new to driver development. I guess <code>0x90a0c000</code> is the physical address of the controller?</p>

<p>To probe the module, I first remapped <code>0x90a0c000</code> to a virtual address using <code>ioremap_nocache</code> and then tried to reserve the memory using <code>request_mem_region</code>. That failed.</p>

<pre><code>ioVirtBase = ioremap_nocache(iommap, 8);

TQTRACE(""ecp_serial_probe: devm_ioremap for MMIO 0x%X returned 0x%X\n"", (uint32_t)iommap, (uint32_t)ioVirtBase);
if (ioVirtBase != NULL)
{
    tqDumpBuffer(ioVirtBase, 8);
}

tqRes = request_mem_region((uint32_t)ioVirtBase, 8, ECP_DRIVER_NAME);
TQTRACE(""ecp_serial_probe: request_mem_region for 0x%X returned 0x%X\n"", (uint32_t)ioVirtBase, (uint32_t)tqRes);
if (!tqRes)
{
    TQTRACE(""ecp_serial_probe: Cannot request memory at 0x%X\n"", (uint32_t)iommap);
    return -ENXIO;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the correct order of the functions?  </p>

<p>Also, it seems <code>request_mem_region</code> fails because the device is under control of <code>80860F0A</code> ??  There is no such entry in <code>lsmod</code> but there is an entry in <code>/sys/devices</code>.</p>

<p>Do I need to unload that driver to control the USART?  How?</p>

<pre><code># ls -l  /sys/devices/platform/80860F0A\:00

<p>This solution takes into account the various flags available for the <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/File.html#method-c-fnmatch"" rel=""nofollow"">File::fnmatch</a> function, and uses the glob pattern to build a suitable <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Regexp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Regexp</a> to match the features.  With this solution, these tests can be run successfully:</p>

<pre><code>File.fnmatch('c{at,ub}s', 'cats', File::FNM_EXTGLOB)
#=&gt; true
File.fnmatch('file{*.doc,*.pdf}', 'filename.doc')
#=&gt; false
File.fnmatch('file{*.doc,*.pdf}', 'filename.doc', File::FNM_EXTGLOB)
#=&gt; true
File.fnmatch('f*l?{[a-z].doc,[0-9].pdf}', 'filex.doc', File::FNM_EXTGLOB)
#=&gt; true
File.fnmatch('**/.{pro,}f?l*', 'home/.profile', File::FNM_EXTGLOB | File::FNM_DOTMATCH)
#=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>fnmatch_with_braces_glob</code> (and <code>?</code> variant) will be patched in place of <code>fnmatch</code>, so that Ruby 2.0.0-compliant code will work with earlier Ruby versions, as well.  For clarity reasons, the code shown above does not include some performance improvements, argument checking, or the Backports feature detection and patch-in code; these will obviously be included in the actual submission to the project.</p>

<p>I'm still testing some edge cases and heavily optimizing performance; it should be ready to submit very soon.  Once it's available in an official Backports release, I'll update the status here.</p>

<p>Note that <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Dir.html#method-c-glob"" rel=""nofollow"">Dir::glob</a> support will be coming at the same time, as well.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; repl_python()
Python 3.6.8 (/data/users/USER/env/bin/python3.6)
Reticulate 1.12.0.9005 REPL -- A Python interpreter in R.
&gt;&gt;&gt; quit
&gt; r.data_py['text'] = r.data_py['text'].str.replace(""[^a-zA-Z]"", "" "")
Error: unexpected symbol in ""r.data_py['text'] = r.data_py['text'].str.replace""

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>An update. The R Studio server was recently updated from RStudio 1.1.xxx to rstudio-server-1.2.1335-1.x86_64.</p>

<p>When I execute the commands in the RStudio ""editor"" I get the error, however when I execute the commands in the console I get no error... So it seems to be a problem here.</p>

<p>How can I resolve this issue?</p>
","3","6353301",""
"1225173","2009-08-03 23:53:05","7","","","","<p>Short answer: Start with Python 2.6.</p>

<p>Why: Programming is more fun and useful when you can leverage the work of others. This means using 3rd party libraries often. Many of the popular libraries for Python don't have 3.x support yet. PIL and NumPy/SciPy come to mind. My favorite interpreter, ipython, also doesn't work with 3.0 yet. Many unit testing frameworks and web frameworks are also not on 3.0 yet.</p>

<p>So if you start out in 3.x many doors will be closed to you, at least until 3.x porting takes on steam. There are admittedly a lot of nice features in Python 3.x, but some of them have been backported to 2.6 and some more will make it into 2.7. So stick with 2.6 for now, and re-evaluate 3.x in a year's time or so.</p>
","0","149416",""
"57101446","2019-07-18 19:26:06","1","","","","<pre><code>class Level(Enum):

    prerequisite_level: Optional[""Level""]
    dependent_level: Optional[""Level""]

    greater_priority_levels: List[""Level""]

    DATA_CHECK = ""data check""
    DESIGN_CHECK = ""design check""
    ALERT = ""alert""
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having a hard time understanding the above: ... [comments clarified that the first four should be attributes, and <code>prequisite</code> and <code>dependent</code> are the previous and following members, respectively].</p>

<p>The solution is to modify previous members as the current member is being initialized (the trick being that the current member isn't added to the parent <code>Enum</code> until after the member's creation and initialization).  Here is the solution using the stdlib's <code>Enum</code><sup>1</sup> (Python 3.6 and later):</p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum, auto

class Level(str, Enum):
    #
    def __init__(self, name):
        # create priority level lists
        self.lower_priority_levels = list(self.__class__._member_map_.values())
        self.greater_priority_levels = []
        # update previous members' greater priority list
        for member in self.lower_priority_levels:
            member.greater_priority_levels.append(self)
        # and link prereq and dependent
        self.prerequisite = None
        self.dependent = None
        if self.lower_priority_levels:
            self.prerequisite = self.lower_priority_levels[-1]
            self.prerequisite.dependent = self
    #
    def _generate_next_value_(name, start, count, last_values, *args, **kwds):
        return (name.lower().replace('_',' '), ) + args
    #
    DATA_CHECK = auto()
    DESIGN_CHECK = auto()
    ALERT = auto()
</code></pre>

<p>and in use:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(Level)
[&lt;Level.DATA_CHECK: 'data check'&gt;, &lt;Level.DESIGN_CHECK: 'design check'&gt;, &lt;Level.ALERT: 'alert'&gt;]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.DATA_CHECK.prerequisite
None

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.DATA_CHECK.dependent
&lt;Level.DESIGN_CHECK: 'design check'&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.DESIGN_CHECK.prerequisite
&lt;Level.DATA_CHECK: 'data check'&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.DESIGN_CHECK.dependent
&lt;Level.ALERT: 'alert'&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.ALERT.prerequisite
&lt;Level.DESIGN_CHECK: 'design check'&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.ALERT.dependent
None
</code></pre>

<p>Note:  If you don't want to see the name twice, a custom <code>__repr__</code> can show just the enum and member names:</p>

<pre><code>    def __repr__(self):
        return '&lt;%s.%s&gt;' % (self.__class__.__name__, self.name)
</code></pre>

<p>then you'll see:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Level.DESIGN_CHECK
&lt;Level.DESIGN_CHECK&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>    String durationString = ""01:00:07"";
    durationString = durationString
            .replaceFirst(""(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})"", ""PT$1H$2M$3S"");
    Duration dur = Duration.parse(durationString);
    System.out.println(dur);
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>Duration</code> outputs this odd string:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PT1H7S</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read as: <em>a period of time of 1 hour 7 seconds</em>. </p>

<p>That string is in standard <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> format. A <code>Duration</code> can only parse the standard format. So I am using <code>String.replaceFirst</code> to convert your string to it.</p>

<p>Let me guess, you need to sum up durations? There’s a <code>plus</code> method for that:</p>

<pre><code>    Duration sum = Duration.ZERO;
    sum = sum.plus(dur);
</code></pre>

<p>There are also methods for converting to seconds or milliseconds.</p>

<p>Don’t use a date-time class for a duration. It will lead to confusion and errors.</p>

<p>If you absolutely don’t want an external dependency (only until you move to API level 26), hand parse your string into seconds and represent them in an <code>int</code>. Wrap it in a custom class of your own.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the new classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

If you need to see your system's exact source code you have to get it from your distribution, they may apply patches, backports. For example if you have a debian system or derivates you can say:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get source libc6

<p>RPM based systems have different methods to get their SRPMs but I'm not familiar with those.</p>

<p>When I try to add the y position with the emmeans test output using the code below (with and without the 'y' argument for add_xy_position(), I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code> test_emms &lt;- test_emms %&gt;% add_xy_position(y = &quot;individuals&quot;)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Error in add_y_position(., fun = fun, step.increase = step.increase,
stack = stack,  :    data and formula arguments should be specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to add data and formula arguments but I still get error messages when I try to run the code. My guess is that this is because I am using a categorical variable on the y axis instead of a continuous one? Or is it another problem? Could someone help please?</p>

<li>See the changes in kernel/common from AOSP for Android 12 and try to port the patches required. But since your kernel is 3.18, I am not sure it can directly go for A12/A13, backporting things are a huge effort.</li>
<li>You should take a look at the kernel changes what communities like LineageOS or Paranoid Android do to support older devices with 3.18.x kernel to run on Android 12 and higher.</li>
<li>Take reference from similar devices from #2 for all subsystems and drivers required.</li>
<li>For vendor specific modules like bluetooth support, try to see if you have any support from #3. In many cases it might be as easy as applying certain commits or it might be as difficult as getting a full port done.</li>

<p>I asked a related question because I can't install pytorch with cuda with conda, see details here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75023120/why-does-conda-install-the-pytorch-cpu-version-despite-me-putting-explicitly-to"">why does conda install the pytorch CPU version despite me putting explicitly to download the cuda toolkit version?</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I think this works:</p>
<pre><code># -- Install PyTorch sometimes requires more careful versioning due to cuda, ref: official install instruction https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
# you need python 3.9 for torch version 1.9.1 to work, due to torchmeta==1.8.0 requirement
if ! python -V 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -q 'Python 3\.9'; then
    echo &quot;Error: Python 3.9 is required!&quot;
    exit 1
fi

pip install torch==1.9.1+cu111 torchvision==0.10.1+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

<p>Due to the existence of a new(er) date and time library it is not recommended to use <code>java.util.Date</code> and <code>java.util.Calendar</code> anymore. The only exception should be a situation where you have to involve considerably large amounts of legacy code.</p>
<p>So… here is the modern way using <code>java.time</code> (Java 8+).</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong></p>
<pre><code>public int getAge(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth) {
    return Period.between(
                LocalDate.of(year, month, dayOfMonth),
                LocalDate.now()
            ).getYears();
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>
<pre class=""lang-kotlin prettyprint-override""><code>fun getAge(year: Int, month: Int, dayOfMonth: Int): Int {
    return Period.between(
                LocalDate.of(year, month, dayOfMonth),
                LocalDate.now()
            ).years
}
</code></pre>
<p>Both snippets need the following imports from <code>java.time</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.Period
</code></pre>
<p>See also <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Since there's <a href=""https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API Desugaring</a> in Android now, there's even no/little need for a backport like
<a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a> which only supported API levels 26 and above in Android.</p>
<p>API desugaring makes (a subset of) <code>java.time</code> directly available to API levels below 26 (well, not really down to version 1, but will do for most of the API levels that should be supported nowadays).</p>

<p>This makes sense of course, if we limit the number of posts that we show it becomes impossible to link to them.</p>

<p>It seems the <code>libp11-kit.so</code> is broken, I may fix the issue by installing the <code>libp11-kit-dev</code> again. But as the <code>apt update</code> does not work anymore, I don't know how to implement this. Or maybe there are any other solutions or suggestions?</p>

<p>If you go to the first link, there are several fixes.  Mine relates to Debian and is reproduced below.  Here too there are multiple ways of doing it (again, see the first link), but I chose to use the one involving Backports.</p>
<p>Create a new sources file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bullseye-backports.list
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following line to the above file:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main
</code></pre>
<p>Then run:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get update
</code></pre>
<p>to update the package list. Finally:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -t bullseye-backports phpmyadmin
</code></pre>
<p>That should do it.  Another solution is to uninstall and then manually install the latest version from the <a href=""https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phpmyadmin website</a>.  That's what I should have done in the first place. :-)</p>

<p><em>&quot;To build and run DITA-OT, you’ll need Java Development Kit (JDK), version 17 or newer.&quot;</em></p>

<p>You are trying to run it on Java 8.  That is not supported in the current version of dita-ot.</p>
<p>If you want to run dita-ot on Java 8, you will need to download and build an older version.  (I think ... prior to version 4.0, though I'm not sure about that.)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Can I change a java class version file without changing the overall version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot &quot;change&quot; the class file version number without recompiling.  And in this case, I don't think that you will succeed in recompile the latest version of dita-ot with Java 8 as the target version.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the <a href=""https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot/issues/3359"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rationale</a> given for changing is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Java 8 is currently still LTS but e.g. Oracle's commercial distribution has been discontinued and the latest LTS version is 17. While e.g. AdoptOpenJDK plans to backport fixes until 2023, new features are being added to the language and it would be nice to be able to use them.</em></p>
<p>Move to Java 17 in the build configuration <strong>to allow using Java 9-17 features</strong>.&quot;*</p>

<p>I assume that they will have started using Java 9+ features by now.</p>

<p>Although the idea you link to about using the garbage collector to list the decorator objects is interesting, it seems arduous, and does not constitute &quot;several strategies&quot;.</p>
<p>I can't see how you're going to get a list of objects any other way unless you make a list of those objects. I suggest you create your own decorator to wrap <code>lru_cache</code> and build a list of the functions in there. Then you can provide your own <code>cache_clear</code> function which iterates over that list.</p>

<p>I'm using the R package <code>{recipes}</code> for data preprocessing. Assume that I would like to transform some variable and then declare the transformed variable as the outcome variable for modeling.</p>
<h1>Problem and minimal example:</h1>
<p>However, an error is thrown:</p>
<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>library(tidymodels)
rec &lt;- recipe( ~ ., data = mtcars) |&gt; 
  step_mutate(mpg2 = mpg * 2) |&gt; 
  update_role(mpg2, new_role = &quot;outcome&quot;)
#&gt; Error in `update_role()`:
#&gt; ! Can't subset columns that don't exist.
#&gt; ✖ Column `mpg2` doesn't exist.
</code></pre>
<p><sup>Created on 2023-01-15 with <a href=""https://reprex.tidyverse.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reprex v2.0.2</a></sup></p>
<h1>What I've tried</h1>
<p>The help pages of <code>step_mutate()</code> and <code>update_role()</code> do not mention the case of updating the role of an mutated variables. When I update the role of a variable without having mutated it, no error is thrown.</p>
<p>There are SO questions around with a similar error message (such as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63974520/tidymodels-problem-performing-pcr-error-cant-subset-columns-that-dont-exist"">here</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63008228/tidymodels-tune-grid-cant-subset-columns-that-dont-exist-when-not-using-for"">here</a>, or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72333419/error-on-running-predict-in-tidymodels-error-in-dplyrselect-cant-su"">here</a>), but those questions seem to tap into different aspects.</p>

I tried creating a virtual environment but it was unsuccessful. Trying to install the virtual env package gets an error <code>E: Package 'python3-venv' has no installation candidate</code></p>
<pre><code>python3 -m venv newpy310
The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.

    apt install python3.10-venv

You may need to use sudo with that command.  After installing the python3-venv
package, recreate your virtual environment.

Failing command: ['/home/user/Desktop/pyenvs/newpy310/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']

<p>I am unsure of where the problem is coming from, the same dockerfile worked fine on the latest tensorfow docker version, could it be normal behaviour because the tensorflow version is a little old?</p>

<p>`</p>
<p>A lot of dependencies had moved to conda-forge, and that, according to your info does not support Python 3.7 any more. That appears to be the likely reason.</p>
<p>As a remedy I reverted to the old revision 10.
It is unfortunate that the update routine does not give one a proper warning. I guess no more conda updates on my machine (have a lot of Python 3.7 scripts running).</p>

"75153360","2023-01-17 23:46:43","2","","","","<p>The reason you are able to get the WinAppDriver to open an application with Selenium <strong>v3.141.59</strong> but not with Selenium <strong>v4.6.0</strong> is due to some major changes between major versions 7 and 8 of Appium java client.</p>
<p>As per the <a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/docs/v7-to-v8-migration-guide.md#strict-w3c-specification-compatibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">v7-to-v8-migration-guide</a> from W3C specification compatibility perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Java client now supports Selenium 4, which also means it is strictly W3C compliant. Old JWP-based servers are not supported anymore, and it
won't be possible to use the new client version with them.
Capabilities that enforce the usage of JWP protocol on Appium drivers
don't have any effect anymore.</li>
<li>The recommended way to provide capabilities for driver creation is to use specific option builders inherited from <a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/io/appium/java_client/remote/options/BaseOptions.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BaseOptions
class</a>.
For example
<a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/io/appium/java_client/ios/options/XCUITestOptions.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XCUITestOptions</a>
to create a XCUITest driver instance or
<a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/io/appium/java_client/android/options/UiAutomator2Options.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UiAutomator2Options</a>
to create an UiAutomator2 driver instance. If there is no
driver-specific options class for your driver then either use
BaseOptions builder as the base class to define your capabilities or
request driver developers to add one. Do not use DesiredCapabilities
class for this purpose in W3C context. Check <a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/src/test/java/io/appium/java_client/drivers/options/OptionsBuildingTest.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unit
tests</a>
for more examples on how to build driver options.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover in the discussion <a href=""https://github.com/appium/java-client/issues/1592#issuecomment-1109188197"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unable to Initiate Session with WinAppDriver</a> <a href=""https://github.com/appium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">@Appium</a> maintainer <em><code>@KazuCocoa </code></em> mentioned that:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The WinAppDriver requires selenium v3 based client for now since Selenium v4 requires W3C spec protocol that is not supported by WinAppDriver yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Further in the discussion <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/issues/1839"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Support for Selenium 4</a> <em><code>@pm90pl</code></em> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah. So, the current version is not compatible with W3C WebDriver standard what makes it incompatible with Selenium 4. There is no clear roadmap for WAD and it's not open source so you have to deal it on your own.
Upgrading Selenium without checking WAD compatibility was a mistake. Sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The only viable option to execute the WinAppDriver based test is to backport to <em><strong>Selenium v3.141.59</strong></em></p>

"75153042","2023-01-17 22:52:36","1","","","","<p>&quot;Generic&quot; in this context means <a href=""https://peps.python.org/pep-0560/#specification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;generic type&quot;</a> (see also <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generic-type"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Glossary</a>), typing-related objects that can be subscripted to generate more specific type &quot;instances&quot; (apologies for the sloppy jargon, I'm not well-versed in typing talk). Think <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.List"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>typing.List</code></a> that lets you use <code>List[int]</code> to denote a homogeneous list of ints.</p>
<p><a href=""https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">As of Python 3.9</a> most standard-library collections have been upgraded to be compatible with typing as generic types themselves. Since <code>tuple[foo]</code> used to be invalid until 3.9, it was safe to allow <code>tuple[int, int]</code> to mean the same thing that <code>typing.Tuple[int, int]</code> used to mean: a tuple of two integers.</p>
<p>So as of 3.9 NumPy also allows using the <code>np.ndarray</code> type as a generic, this is what <code>np.ndarray[Any, np.dtype[Any]]</code> does. This &quot;signature&quot; matches the <a href=""https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">actual signature of <code>np.ndarray.__init__()</code></a> (<code>__new__()</code> if we want to be correct):</p>
<pre><code>class numpy.ndarray(shape, dtype=float, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>So what <code>np.ndarray[foo, bar]</code> does is create a type for type hinting that means &quot;a NumPy array of shape type <code>foo</code> and dtype <code>bar</code>&quot;. People normally don't call <code>np.ndarray()</code> directly anyway (rather using helpers such as <code>np.array()</code> or <code>np.full_like()</code> and the like), so this is doubly fine in NumPy.</p>
<p>Now, since most code runs with arrays of more than one possible number of dimensions, it would be a pain to have to specify an arbitrary number of lengths for the shape tuple (the first &quot;argument&quot; of <code>np.ndarray</code> as a generic type). I assume this was the motivation to define a type alias that is still a generic in the <em>second</em> &quot;argument&quot;. This is <code>np.typing.NDArray</code>.</p>
<p>It lets you easily type hint something as an array of a given type without having to say anything about the shape, covering a vast subset of use cases (which would otherwise use <code>np.ndarray[typing.Any, ...]</code>). And this is still a generic, since you can parameterise it with a dtype. To quote <a href=""https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/typing.html#numpy.typing.NDArray"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the docs</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(npt.NDArray)
numpy.ndarray[typing.Any, numpy.dtype[+ScalarType]]

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(npt.NDArray[np.float64])
numpy.ndarray[typing.Any, numpy.dtype[numpy.float64]]
</code></pre>
<p>As usual with generics, you're allowed to specify an argument to the generic type, but you're not required to. <a href=""https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/bdec32181605c8179fd79624d14c1cf019de75af/numpy/_typing/_generic_alias.py#L238"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ScalarType</code></a> is derived from <code>np.generic</code>, a base class that covers most (maybe all) NumPy scalar types. And the library code that defines <code>NDArray</code> is <a href=""https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/bdec32181605c8179fd79624d14c1cf019de75af/numpy/_typing/_generic_alias.py#L240-L245"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, and is fairly transparent to the point of calling the helper <code>_GenericAlias</code> for older Python (a backport of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.GenericAlias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>typing.GenericAlias</code></a>). What you have at the end is a type alias that is still generic in one variable.</p>
<hr />
<p>To address the last part of your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why can I do <code>np.ndarray[float]</code>, ie just use one argument? What does that mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the anticlimactic explanation is that we again need to look at the signature of <code>np.ndarray()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class numpy.ndarray(shape, dtype=float, buffer=None, offset=0, strides=None, order=None)
</code></pre>
<p>There's one mandatory parameter (<code>shape</code>), all the others are optional. So I believe that <code>np.ndarray[float]</code> specifies that it corresponds to arrays whose shape is of type <code>float</code> (i.e. nonsense). There's <a href=""https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/291b301f109f82564083dccda4b11f3949759778/numpy/core/src/multiarray/methods.c#L2838-L2847"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an explicit check to only allow 1 or 2 parameters in the generic type</a>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>    args_len = PyTuple_Check(args) ? PyTuple_Size(args) : 1;
    if ((args_len &gt; 2) || (args_len == 0)) {
        return PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                            &quot;Too %s arguments for %s&quot;,
                            args_len &gt; 2 ? &quot;many&quot; : &quot;few&quot;,
                            ((PyTypeObject *)cls)-&gt;tp_name);
    }
    generic_alias = Py_GenericAlias(cls, args);
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet checks that two arguments were passed to <code>__class_getitem__</code>, raises otherwise, and in the valid cases defers to <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typehints.html?highlight=py_genericalias#c.Py_GenericAlias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the C API version of <code>typing.GenericAlias</code></a>.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that there's no <em>technical</em> reason to exclude the other parameters of the <code>ndarray</code> constructor from the generic type, but there was a semantic reason that the third parameter, <code>buffer</code> makes no sense to be included typing (or there was just a general push to reduce the generality of the generic type to most common use cases).</p>
<p>All that being said, I haven't been able to construct a small example in which a type passed for the <code>shape</code> of the generic type leads to type checking errors in <code>mypy</code>. From several attempts it seems as if the shape was always checked as if it were <code>typing.Any</code> rather than whatever was passed as the first parameter of <code>np.ndarray[...]</code>. For instance, consider the following example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import numpy as np

first: np.ndarray[tuple[int], np.dtype[np.int64]] = np.arange(3)  # OK

second: np.ndarray[tuple[int], np.dtype[np.int64]] = np.arange(3.0)  # error due to dtype mismatch

third: np.ndarray[tuple[int, int, int], np.dtype[np.int64]] = np.arange(3)  # no error even though shape mismatch
</code></pre>
<p>Running mypy 0.991 on Python 3.9 on this gives</p>
<pre><code>foo.py:5: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type &quot;ndarray[Any, dtype[floating[Any]]]&quot;, variable has type &quot;ndarray[Tuple[int], dtype[signedinteger[_64Bit]]]&quot;)  [assignment]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</code></pre>
<p>Only the dtype mismatch is found, but not the shape mismatch. And I see the same thing if I use <code>np.ndarray((3,), dtype=...)</code> instead of <code>np.arange()</code>, so it's not just due to weird typing of the <code>np.arange()</code> helper (although I used it as an example because this is one function that's guaranteed to return a 1d array). Since I can't explain this behaviour I can't be certain that my understanding is correct, but I have no better model.</p>
<p>To come back to a question you asked in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right, so then am I right in understanding that np.ndarray[int] is like np.ndarray[Any, int]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, at least we can exlude this (and what we see here is consistent with the first parameter only affecting the shape to whatever extent it does affect it):</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from typing import Any

import numpy as np

first: np.ndarray[Any, np.dtype[np.int_]] = np.arange(3)  # OK because dtype matches

second: np.ndarray[np.dtype[np.int_]] = np.arange(3)  # OK because shape check doesn't actually work, and dtype is left as &quot;any scalar&quot;

third: np.ndarray[Any, np.dtype[np.int_]] = np.arange(3.0)  # error due to dtype mismatch

fourth: np.ndarray[np.dtype[np.int_]] = np.arange(3.0)  # no error, so this can't be the same as the third option
</code></pre>
<p>The result from <code>mypy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>foo.py:7: error: &quot;ndarray&quot; expects 2 type arguments, but 1 given  [type-arg]
foo.py:9: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type &quot;ndarray[Any, dtype[floating[Any]]]&quot;, variable has type &quot;ndarray[Any, dtype[signedinteger[Any]]]&quot;)  [assignment]
foo.py:11: error: &quot;ndarray&quot; expects 2 type arguments, but 1 given  [type-arg]
Found 3 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</code></pre>
<p>The four cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>first</code>: explicitly typed as &quot;int array with any shape&quot;, no error on type correct assignment</li>
<li><code>second</code>: typed as &quot;array with an int-typed shape and any dtype&quot;, should fail because that's nonsense but doesn't (see the earlier musing about the impotence of shape type checks)</li>
<li><code>third</code>: explicitly typed as another &quot;int array with any shape&quot;, being assigned a <em>double</em> array, leading to an error</li>
<li><code>fourth</code>: typed as &quot;array with an int-typed shape and any dtype&quot;, leading to no error (see <code>second</code>). Since the third case leads to an error and the fourth doesn't, they can't be aliases of one another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also notable that mypy complains about the two lines where <code>np.ndarray[np.dtype[np.int_]]</code> is present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>foo.py:7: error: &quot;ndarray&quot; expects 2 type arguments, but 1 given  [type-arg]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a single-parameter use of the generic is forbidden as far as mypy is concerned. I'm not sure why this is the case, but this would certainly simplify the situation.</p>

"75164575","2023-01-18 19:49:41","0","","","","<p>ALPN is a TLS extension for negotiating the protocol the connection will use. I'm assuming you're using a prebuilt gRPC Python artifact and not one built from source. If you're building from source, the answer will be slightly different.</p>
<p>gRPC Python supports ALPN, so the issue is likely with either the server or with a proxy sitting between the client and the server. All officially supported gRPC server implementations support ALPN.</p>
<p>How is the server running? Which language? Which version of gRPC? Do you have any proxies that could be stripping the ALPN property?</p>
<p>This is definitely the first time I've seen a Stackoverflow question with a ChatGPT query included. So here's a quick critique of its response as well:</p>
<p>The first two paragraphs are a great summary. Totally correct. After that, it seems to start making things up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that the gRPC client and server support the same protocols. For example, if the server only supports HTTP/2, the client must also support HTTP/2. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only official transport for gRPC is HTTP/2, so this doesn't make much sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that the client is properly configured to use ALPN. This can typically be done by installing the OpenSSL library and making sure that the grpc._cython.cygrpc package is using it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SSL library (whether BoringSSL or OpenSSL) is statically compiled into the Cython layer of gRPC Python, so this wouldn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the error message still persist and you are using python version 3.8 and above. There is a known issue with the gRPC library in python 3.8 and above, you can upgrade to python version 3.9 and above which will fix the issue. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We run a full suite of tests against gRPC Python on 3.8. This is not only wrong -- it's a bad rumor.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also just realized this also doesn't make any sense. It says that &quot;there's an issue with <em>3.8 and above</em>&quot;. How would upgrading to 3.9 fix that then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the above step did not work, you can try downgrading the gRPC library version, it could be possible that the version you are using is not compatible with the python version you are using </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly the same comment as the previous item. We have very few issues that are specific to a certain version of CPython. It <em>is</em> possible for there to be a regression in gRPC, in which case downgrading the library is a reasonable response, but we would definitely appreciate a bug report in that case so that we can fix the issue and backport to all affected released versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are behind a proxy server, you may need to configure your client to use a proxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this might be true in general for networked clients, I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense in this particular case. You're clearly not trying to use (for example) HTTP CONNECT-based proxying, which <em>would</em> require client-side configuration. If you need to make a change to proxy configuration, it will likely be configuration on the proxy itself.</p>

Now suddenly, I have a need to make sure that all this code works properly under an older version of Python 3.  I can't get the user to update to a more recent Python version -- that's not an option.  So I need to identify all the instances where I've used some functionality that was introduced since the old version they have installed, so I can remove it or develop workarounds.</p>
<p>Approach #1:  eyeball all the code and compare against documentation.  Not ideal when there's this much code to look at.</p>
<p>Approach #2:  create a virtual environment locally based on the old version in question using pyenv, run everything, see where it fails, and make fixes.  I'm doing this anyway, because backporting to the older Python will also mean going backwards in a number of needed third-party modules from PyPi, and I'll need to make sure that the suite still functions properly.  But I don't think it's a good way to identify all my version incompatibilities, because much of the code is only exercised based on particular characteristics of input data, and it'd be hard to make sure I exercise all the code (I don't yet have good unit tests that ensure every line will get executed).</p>
<p>Approach #3:  in my virtual environment based on the older version, I used pyenv to install the pylint module, then used this pylint module to check my code.  It ran; but it didn't identify issues with standard library calls.  For example, I know that several of my functions call subprocess.run() with the &quot;check_output=&quot; Boolean argument, which didn't become available until version 3.7.  I expected the 3.6 pylint run to spot this and yell at me; but it didn't.  Does pylint not check standard library calls against definitions?</p>

<p>I'm adding my updated answer here, and leaving the original below with some original details</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As reported on a <a href=""https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=13494"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chrome issue</a> the latest version of International Components for Unicode (ICU) causes <code>Date.prototype.toLocaleString</code> to use a unicode <code>U+202F</code> character instead of an ascii space character.</p>
<p>That causes code like this to fail with an <code>Invalid Date</code> error</p>
<pre><code>new Date((new Date()).toLocaleString('en-US')) 
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>dayjs</code> uses <a href=""https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/blob/9c20e77caf7b1b5eccf418175203b198d4e29535/src/plugin/timezone/index.js#L98"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that pattern</a> in the timezone plugin (even though it's mostly considered an anti-pattern).</p>
<pre><code>const target = date.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: timezone })
const diff = Math.round((date - new Date(target)) / 1000 / 60)
</code></pre>
<p>This issue is <a href=""https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45573"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fixed</a> in Node 19 and backported to Node 18.13 (LTS). On older versions of Node, it only affects systems with an updated version of the ICU library.</p>
<p>There are similar fixes from <a href=""https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/2ada52cffbff11074abfaac18938bf02d85454f5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chrome</a>, <a href=""https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D160188"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mozilla</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/1dc01f753d89a85ee19df8e8bd75f4aece80c594"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebKit</a> for their respective browsers.</p>
<h2>Possible fixes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Patch <code>dayjs</code> (e.g. via <code>yarn patch</code> <a href=""https://yarnpkg.com/cli/patch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://yarnpkg.com/cli/patch</a>) and replace the unicode character with a string before it gets re-parsed.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>const target = date.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: timezone }).replace(/[\u202f]/, &quot; &quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Upgrade your browser to a version with the fix implemented.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Original below</h1>
<p>I don't have enough reputation to comment, but I believe I'm seeing the same behavior in a node project, and this is the only mention I've been able to find about it online. This started happening last week some time (I started noticing test failures on Jan 20)</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>M1 Macbook Air on MacOS 12.5.1 (Monterey)</p>
<p>dayjs version <code>1.10.7</code> (hasn't been upgraded in 14 months)</p>
<p>node version <code>16.19.0</code></p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>I have essentially the same repro as you that I'm running via <code>jest</code> (this first popped up for me as local tests failures). Note that I'm getting local time via <code>dayjs()</code> so there's definitely no parsing issue here.</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>import dayjs from &quot;dayjs&quot;
import timezone from &quot;dayjs/plugin/timezone&quot;
import utc from &quot;dayjs/plugin/utc&quot;

dayjs.extend(timezone)
dayjs.extend(utc)

export class TimeUtil {
  public debug(time = dayjs()) {
    console.log('Debug Information:')
    console.log('time:', time.format())
    console.log('utc:', time.utc().format())
    console.log('tz:', time.tz('America/New_York').format())
    console.log('time valid? ', time.isValid() ? 'Yes' : 'No')
    console.log('utc valid? ', time.utc().isValid() ? 'Yes' : 'No')
    console.log('tz valid? ', time.tz('America/New_York').isValid() ? 'Yes' : 'No')
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output shows the timezone dayjs object is invalid</p>
<pre><code>$ yarn test tztest

Debug Information:
time: 2023-01-24T12:00:20-08:00
utc: 2023-01-24T20:00:20Z
tz: Invalid Date
time valid?  Yes
utc valid?  Yes
tz valid?  No
</code></pre>
<h2>Docker workaround (not viable long-term)</h2>
<p>The failure behavior does not occur in a <code>node:16.19.0</code> docker container with the exact same source mounted as a volume.</p>
<pre><code>version: '2'
services:
  api-on-node:
    image: node:16.19.0
    container_name: api-on-node
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    working_dir: /app
    tty: true
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ docker exec -it api-on-node yarn test tztest

Debug Information:
time: 2023-01-24T12:00:21-08:00
utc: 2023-01-24T20:00:21Z
tz: 2023-01-24T15:00:21-05:00
time valid?  Yes
utc valid?  Yes
tz valid?  Yes
</code></pre>
<p>So this does seem to be very environment specific. And it is new behavior, although I haven't been able to figure out what changed to cause the new behavior.</p>

<p>I compared the two dataset but nothing seems really different between the one working and this one. I had a look on the function compute_geom_1(). It asks a self and data. It seems that the error message appears when it can not find the data. I tried several combinations, the error appears even without the lfcShrink (using results function instead). The structure of the colData and counts are exactly the same. I just can't see where the error could be. If you have any clue, it would be really helpful.</p>

"75240209","2023-01-25 21:46:19","1","","","","<p>It looks like <code>igraph</code> may have changed since the excellent <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/51390197/9096420"">answer</a> by @G5W was posted. The igraph documentation for <code>closeness</code> has changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closeness centrality of a vertex is defined as the inverse of the sum of distances to all the other vertices in the graph:</p>
<p>If there is no (directed) path between vertex v and i, then i is
omitted from the calculation. If no other vertices are reachable from
v, then its closeness is returned as NaN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so has the output. Using the original example:</p>
<pre><code>g &lt;- graph(c(&quot;Amy&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;,
          &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Li&quot;,
          &quot;Li&quot;, &quot;Amy&quot;,
          &quot;Amy&quot;, &quot;Li&quot;,
          &quot;Kate&quot;, &quot;Li&quot;), directed=TRUE)

closeness(g, mode = &quot;out&quot;)

      Amy       Ram        Li      Kate 
0.5000000 0.3333333 0.3333333 0.1666667 
</code></pre>
<p>The results differ from the above example and the correct answer isn't reproduced by the accepted answer (linked above and reproduced here) because the function igraph::closeness has presumably changed:</p>
<pre><code>Dist &lt;- distances(g, mode=&quot;out&quot;)
Dist[Dist == Inf] &lt;- vcount(g)
1/rowSums(Dist)

      Amy       Ram        Li      Kate 
0.1666667 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1666667 
</code></pre>
<p>Note: this still matches the output of @G5W, but no longer matches <code>closeness(g, mode = &quot;out&quot;)</code>. Instead something more similar to the OP, except with <code>rowSums</code> rather than <code>rowMeans</code> gives a match to <code>igraph::closeness</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dist &lt;- distances(g, mode=&quot;out&quot;)
Dist[Dist == Inf] &lt;- NA
1/rowSums(Dist,na.rm=T)

      Amy       Ram        Li      Kate

Python 3.8+ is required, but there is a backport <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">importlib-metadata</a> for older Python versions. This is the easy case, because installed packages have already generated the metadata (including dependency specs) at installation time. For local source trees which aren't necessarily installed, read on.</p>
<p>There is a way to do this in Python APIs via distutils (which setuptools wraps):</p>
<pre><code>import distutils.core
dist = distutils.core.run_setup(&quot;setup.py&quot;)
for req in dist.install_requires:
    print(req)
</code></pre>
<p>As a shell command that might look like:</p>
<pre><code>python -c 'import distutils.core; print(*distutils.core.run_setup(&quot;setup.py&quot;).install_requires, sep=&quot;\n&quot;)'
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to use the CLI to generate egg-info and then read deps from that:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py egg_info
cat myproject.egg-info/requires.txt
</code></pre>
<p>However, distutils is deprecated and setuptools is trying to be a library only, so using <code>setup.py</code> in this way is quite neglected.</p>
<p>You might consider moving to declarative dependencies specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and then just reading the requirements directly with a simple TOML parser.</p>

I've tried running this same block of code in Spyder IDE and VScode, each time the cell runs for about 35-45s then returns a message that the kernel crashed unexpectedly and and new kernel is created. Im using Python 3.10 with Anaconda package manager.</p>
<p>Spyder had no information about the kernel crash but in VScode I was pointed to this github post <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Kernel-crashes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kernel-crashes</a>. I figured somehow my numpy installation was affecting kernel performance or execution. I created a new virtual env using conda; re-installed numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn, etc. Same kernel crash occurring with the same message.</p>
<p>I am using a new Macbook with the m1 chip. Unsure if that's has an influence or is a hint at how to solve this issue. Did see the sci-kit learn installation docs had separate section <a href=""https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#install-official-release"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sci-kit learn install docs</a> about installing with m1 chip but to be honest wasn't exactly sure how to interpret and use that info.</p>
<p>this is the code Im trying to run that causes the kernel to crash. the <code>pca_features</code> is the numpy array return after running <code>.fit_transform</code> method on my raw data. PCA executed fine for what it's worth and showed no issues. Tried using subset of rows, first 5000, to see if that helped cell run at all but still no luck.</p>
<p>Error Message:
<strong>The Kernel crashed while executing code in the the current cell or a previous cell. Please review the code in the cell(s) to identify a possible cause of the failure. Click <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Kernel-crashes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more info. View Jupyter log for further details.

<p>Im open to other clustering algorithms but fact that I can't get this to execute makes me less confident any others (e.g. KMeans) would successfully run. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>My goal is get a unsupervised clustering algorithm fitted to the data so I can get labels for each observation and compare it against primary components from PCA.</p>
<pre><code>```
aggclus = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters = 4, affinity=&quot;euclidean&quot;,linkage=&quot;ward&quot;) 
subset_pcafeatures = pca_features[:5000,5]
cluster_labels = aggclus.fit_predict(pca_features)
```

<ul>
<li>Some parts of the API (such as JAXB, which has been around since at least Java 6) have never been available on Android.</li>
<li>When features of a new Java version are introduced, this can happen gradually over multiple versions.</li>
<li>Some newer Java features are made available for older, already-released versions as backports.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past it has taken Google some 2–3 years to start adopting a new Java version. Java 7 features started appearing around API 19 (KitKat). Java 8 features started at API 26 (Nougat), but a mechanism called <a href=""https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">desugaring</a> is available to make certain Java 8 features available on earlier Android versions, regardless of their API level.</p>
<p>So, generally speaking, if you want to know whether a particular Java API feature is available on Android, look it up on the Android developer reference and check the minimum API version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is what I am doing bad practice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>No.</strong> You following the official documentation and what you do is correct. The problem is that there is a bug within the types generated for the PySide.
PySide/Qt is written in C++ and there only Python Bindings generated for it.</p>
<p>Typing Support for Python is fairly new and still under active development.
So in general you will run into troubles from time to time using it.
This also means that there is no straight forward way to convert the C++ typing information into Python type informations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to make Pycharm and mypy not complain about this way of connecting a button?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. There are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Wait until the bug is fixed in PySide (i.e. in Version 6.5.0, but if you look at the <a href=""https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-1603"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">related issue</a>, there are also some backports to older versions)</p>

"75358488","2023-02-06 07:36:53","0","","","","<p>I will first introduce the general solution and then show how it can be adapted for this particular use case.</p>
<h3>General solution</h3>
<p>Nowadays there are easier ways to debug such things utilizing the new functionalities of the python import system. Basically just add your own module finders (MetaPathFinder) to <strong><a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sys.meta_path</code></a></strong>. Here is an example  for a script importing <code>pandas</code> and listing all the succesful imports in <code>imported</code> and unsuccesful imports in <code>could_not_be_imported</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import sys

imported = []
could_not_be_imported = []


class FirstFinder:
    def find_spec(self, modulename, path=None, target=None):
        imported.append(modulename)


class LastFinder:
    def find_spec(self, modulename, path=None, target=None):
        imported.remove(modulename)
        could_not_be_imported.append(modulename)

# setup (&quot;start recording imports&quot;)
sys.meta_path.insert(0, FirstFinder())
sys.meta_path.append(LastFinder())

import pandas # import anything here 

# cleanup (&quot;stop recording&quot;)
sys.meta_path = [
    x for x in sys.meta_path if not isinstance(x, (FirstFinder, LastFinder))
]
</code></pre>
<p>The list containing the succesful imports is then <strong><code>imported</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; imported
['pandas',
 'numpy',
 'numpy._globals',
 # ...
 'pandas.io.sql',
 'pandas.io.stata',
 'pandas.io.xml',
 'pandas.util._tester',
 'pandas._version']
</code></pre>
<p>and <strong><code>could_not_be_imported</code></strong>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; could_not_be_imported 
['pickle5',
 'org',
 'fcntl',
 'backports_abc',
 'six.moves',
 'backports_abc',
 'backports_abc',
 # ...
 'cloudpickle',
 'numexpr',
 'bottleneck',
 'org',
 'backports_abc',
 'backports_abc',
 'backports_abc']
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There can be duplicates in either of the lists and all the modules are listed in order of imports. Modify as fits to your needs.</p>
<h3>Specific use case: Finding Erroneous import</h3>
<p>Modify the <code>LastFinder</code> to be:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>class LastFinder:
    def find_spec(self, modulename, path=None, target=None):
        imported.remove(modulename)
        print(
            &quot;\nMissing module! &quot;,
            f&quot;Tried to import: {modulename}\n&quot;,
            &quot;Last few last imports:\n\t&quot;,
            &quot;\n\t &quot;.join(imported[-10:]),
        )
        could_not_be_imported.append(modulename)
</code></pre>
<p>This will then print, with every missing module, a list of the few last succesfully imported modules and the module you were trying to import. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Missing module!  Tried to import: bottleneck
 Last few last imports:
         pandas.core.ops.common
         pandas.core.ops.docstrings
         pandas.core.ops.mask_ops
         pandas.core.ops.methods
         pandas.core.missing
         pandas.core.array_algos.quantile
         pandas.core.sorting
         pandas.core.arrays.boolean
         pandas.core.arrays.masked
         pandas.core.nanops
</code></pre>
<p>In this case this would mean that the <code>pandas.core.nanops</code> was the last succcesful import before the unsuccesful import. Therefore, it would be quite easy to check from <code>pandas.core.nanops.__file__</code> where the broken import is. (look for <code>&quot;bottleneck&quot;</code> in the file). In my case, I found:</p>
<pre><code># pandas\core\nanops.py
# ...
bn = import_optional_dependency(&quot;bottleneck&quot;, errors=&quot;warn&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h3>How this works?</h3>
<p>The python import system goes through the <code>sys.meta_path</code> to look for a spec finder which will have <code>find_spec</code> method which returns something else than <code>None</code>. If <code>None</code> is returned, next finder in <code>sys.meta_path</code> is used for the import.</p>

<p>A few points to note before proceeding further:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main purpose for having this custom input is to validate what gets stored in my model's JSONField.</li>
<li>I want to allow my Frontend app to pass javascript objects as parameters instead of passing JSON strings.</li>
<li>I can not use the <code>GenericScalar</code> type as mentioned <a href=""https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/issues/384#issuecomment-411534718"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> because it accepts anything and requires custom validations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's what I've tried/discovered so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>On executing the mutation, it throws this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48454398/typeerror-at-en-object-of-type-proxy-is-not-json-serializable"">Object of type <strong>proxy</strong> is not JSON serializable</a> on the following line:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>race_report = RaceReport.objects.create(user=info.context.user, parameters=parameters)
</code></pre>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Tried converting it to dictionary by using <code>parameters.__dict__</code> method but got the same error.</li>
<li>Tried a manaul <code>json.dumps(parameters)</code> but still same results.</li>
<li>Did some research and found out that the <code>JSONField</code> uses the default json encoders and decoders provided by python's built-in <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">json package</a>.</li>
<li>Thought something is wrong with the <code>JSONEncoder</code> itself and tried <a href=""https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-old/blob/master/django/core/serializers/json.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DjangoJSONEncoder</a>, and finally it worked!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now my <code>mutation</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def mutate(_root, info, parameters):  # noqa: N805
    parameters = json.dumps(parameters, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)
    parameters = json.loads(parameters)

    race_report = RaceReport.objects.create(user=info.context.user, parameters=parameters)
    return CreateRaceReport(race_report=race_report)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>JSONField</code> accepts custom <code>encoder</code> and <code>decoder</code> classes. But it starts throwing the same error on trying something like this:</p>
<pre><code>JSONField(blank=True, default=dict, encoder=DjangoJSONEncoder)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Versions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.7</li>
<li>Django 2.2.28</li>
<li>Graphene 2.1.8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a better way to do this?</strong></p>

"75425605","2023-02-12 07:58:13","2","","","","<p>I was able to reproduce your issue with Rails 6.1.7.2 and Ruby 3.2.1. The problem is that Rails 6.1 and Ruby 3.2 aren't fully compatible. There are efforts to backport 3.2 compatibility fixes to Rails 6.1 (see <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46895"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46895</a>) but they haven't been released yet it seems.</p>
<p>You could upgrade to a lower version of Ruby instead (3.1.2 worked fine for me, I'm sure 3.1.3 would too), or you could change your mailer code to be like this:</p>
<pre><code>  def notify(recipient_emails, subject, body)
    [omitted]
  end
</code></pre>
<p>(and obviously also change how you call that function).</p>
<p>There's some risk, though, that you'll run into more kwargs related issues with Rails 6.1 and Ruby 3.2, so maybe going with Ruby 3.1 is the better option.</p>

<p>Security Alert: Your app contains embedded private keys or keystore files This app contains one or more private keys or keystore files embedded in its published APK as listed at the end of this message. These embedded items can be accessed by third parties, which can raise a variety of different security concerns depending on what the key is used for. For example, if the private key is the signing key for your application, a third party could sign and distribute apps that replace your authentic apps or corrupt them. Such a party could also sign and distribute apps under your identity. As a general security practice, we strongly recommend against embedding private keys and keystore files in apps, even if the keys are password protected or obfuscated. The most effective way to protect your private key and keystore files are not to circulate them. Please remove your private keys and keystore files from your app at your earliest convenience.

"75458955","2023-02-15 11:14:15","11","","","","<p>I ran your code on my local machine with Fedora 37 and R 4.2.2. As the other commenters, I also got the result you got on Windows. Then I pulled the <a href=""https://rocker-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rocker</a> image for R version 3.6.3:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>docker run -ti rocker/r-ver:3.6.3 R
</code></pre>
<p>This image is also Debian-based. Here I was able to recreate the result you got on your system.</p>
<p>Then I moved to the rocker versioned release 4.0.0:</p>
<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>docker run -ti rocker/r-ver:4.0.0 R
</code></pre>
<p>Here the result was the same as you got on Windows and everyone else got on their machine. It must be noted that with R 4.0.0 the rocker project moved from Debian-based images to Ubuntu LTS.</p>
<p>Fedora comes with the ability to easily <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/fedora/#blaslapack-switching"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">switch the BLAS/LAPACK backend via the <code>flexiblas</code> package</a>. Thanks to that, I was able to test your code with the eight different backends available on my system. As you can see below, they do yield different results. In particular, the <code>ATLAS</code> backend comes somewhat close to the result you got. In contrast, <code>OPENBLAS-OPENMP</code> (the default on Fedora), other <code>OPENBLAS</code> variants, and <code>NETLIB</code> all produce the same result as you received on Windows. A third family <code>BLIS</code> produces yet another set of possible results.</p>
<p>Is one of the results better than the others? Yes! <code>optim()</code> looks for a result that minimizes the supplied function. In its returned list, it reports not just the minimizing parameters, but also the value for them. I've included that in the table below. So the <code>ATLAS</code> backend wins the prize here. It must be said that <code>optim()</code> does NOT minimize analytically. So it always gives approximate results. That is why initial values and the method matter for what results we get. And apparently, with your function the backend also matters. And if you look at the parameters you got on Buster the function goes to <code>0.002800321</code>. So it is actually a better result than what we all get on our more modern systems, except for the result I got with <code>ATLAS</code>. That also happens to be much slower than the other backends. So it seems, the newer backends might have traded speed for accuracy.</p>
<p>If your aim is consistency across platforms, you can upgrade your system to Debian 11 Bullseye, since that appears to have a backend producing the same results as other modern platforms, as the answer by @jay.sf indicates. You could also investigate if you can find the same BLAS backend version used on Buster for Windows.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can try to change to another blas library on your current system. <a href=""https://csantill.github.io/RPerformanceWBLAS/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a guide how to do that</a>. Though it is for Ubuntu, as both use <code>apt</code>, it should work for your system as well. (<strong>Edit</strong>: I tried that in a VM for Buster. None of the available BLAS backends produced the same result as on the more modern systems)</p>
<p>Finally, if you feel you must have a newer BLAS library on your older system, then you could try to <a href=""https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/staff/procedures/backporting-packages/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backport it yourself</a>. I have no experience with this. I don't know how advisable it is or how likely to succeed. I am just mentioning it for completeness.</p>

<p>The two different samples have different amounts of replicates (6 replicates vs 5 replicates) which might be the reason for these weird results (since when i remove one sample the results are no longer &quot;weird&quot;).</p>
<p>So, the results:</p>
<p>First of all, the condition I'm using is:</p>
<pre><code>   name     Type
total_1 t_24
total_2 t_24
total_3 t_24
total_4 t_24
total_5 t_24
nuc_1   n_24
nuc_2   n_24
nuc_3   n_24
nuc_4   n_24
nuc_5   n_24
nuc_6   n_24
</code></pre>
<p>Since the total is the control, they need to be the first for the LFC to be positive when up-regulated in the test.</p>
<p>Now the code I'm using is</p>
<pre><code>df_conditions &lt;- data.frame(
  sample = df_conditions$name,
  condition = df_conditions$Type
)

# The data is only a fraction of the &quot;data_combined&quot; were c(c(9,10,11,12,13,14) corresponds to the nuclear fraction 
DEA_matrix &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(data_combined[c(9,10,11,12,13,14,23,24,25,26,27)],          
                                     df_conditions, 
                                     ~condition) 

DEA &lt;- DESeq(DEA_matrix)
DEA_results &lt;- results(DEA)

</code></pre>
<p>When i ran my sample I get around 350 genes with NAs (in both p-value and padj) which, after looking both online and on the manual means that there is a problem with cooks distance value.
After checking these values for the genes using <code>assays(DEA)[[&quot;cooks&quot;]]</code> i saw that, for example:
For a given gene which has NAs i got these cook's distance values</p>
<pre><code>    nuc_1        nuc_2         nuc_3       nuc_4        nuc_5         nuc_6       total_1     total_2      total_3     total_4      total_5 
1.479392e-04 1.548888e-02 1.557630e-04 2.008926e-01 1.012255e-01 2.222557e+01 5.412296e-01 1.156913e+00 9.553727e-01 1.107007e+00 1.146971e+00
</code></pre>
<p>Which indicates that nuc_6 is clearly the outlier but the normalized reads do not indicate that (keep in mind that these are approximate values and not the actual values) :</p>
<pre><code>nuc_1   nuc_2   nuc_3   nuc_4   nuc_5   nuc_6   total_1 total_2 total_3 total_4 total_5
400      350    400     450      300     400      50     30      30      30     30

</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone have any idea as to why the cook's value is so weird and indicating an outlier when clearly there isnt one? Could it be the difference in the sample number? I've already tried inverting the order of the condition dataframe (put the nuclear first) but the results remain the same so I don't think its wrongly identifying the nuc_6 as part of the total.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>So far I've tried removing the sample nuc_6 which solved the issue.
I've tried changing the order of the conditions (putting nuclear first and then total) but the problem remains.</p>

<p>I am already using react in the project (hence it found 18.2.0), so I can't just install it a second time.</p>
<p>I looked into creating aliases, but this won't help me because in my dependencies, react is imported just as <code>react</code> - no way to change this to <code>react-latest</code> or similar. I then tried my luck with <a href=""https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pnpm overrides</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field allows you to instruct pnpm to override any dependency in the dependency graph. This is useful to enforce all your packages to use a single version of a dependency, backport a fix, or replace a dependency with a fork.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried it like this in my <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;pnpm&quot;: {
  &quot;overrides&quot;: {
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;18.2.0&quot;

<p>I was hoping this would be a clean way to deal with this, but the warning is still show. Seems like my last chance is accepting it and adding <code>strict-peer-dependencies=false</code> to my .npmrc to stop this to fail the install process. But is there maybe a cleaner way to deal with this?</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b test $( git commit-tree -p HEAD~2 -p origin/develop -m ""Merging develop"" ${HEAD^tree} )
</code></pre>

<p>There you created (and checked out) a test branch that has the same working tree as your HEAD revision and has your feature branch - 2 revisions (in other words, the last revision before the 2 backward merges) and the tip of develop. This way, you got what you wanted, you didn't have to redo any merge (and no merge conflicts).</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> when working with feature branches, there's no need to do <em>backward</em> merges.... it's much better (if you ask me) to get straight stories for feature branches and for that you should <em>rebase</em> instead of merge. You have 3 revisions.... develop moved? You rebase, you sill get your 3 revisions one after the other.... you write 2 more revisions, develop moves? You rebase again, you <em>still</em> get your 5 revisions one after the other. This simplifies a lot of work in terms of seeing what development was all about <em>and</em> also has advantages if you want to move that development on top of other branches, like a backport, por example.</p>

<p>None of the lambdas needs access to the enclosing instance. That's important as it allows the form to be garbage collected.</p>

<p>However, with retrolambdas, they get converted to an inner class and as <a href=""https://www.codenameone.com/blog/java-8-support.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I was told</a>, they <em>use <code>this</code> as a reference to their surrounding class so they have a reference to their parent just like non-static inner classes.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, the lambda in my first snippet is stateless, nonetheless, it was converted to a class having an instance variable of type <code>MyForm1</code>. The above optimization is missing.</p>

<p>The lambda in my second snippet has two instance variables and needs no reference to the enclosing class, so it could be converted to a nested class like</p>

<pre><code>@RequiredArgsConstructor static class MyForm2$Lambda1 implements Runnable {
    private final State currentState;
    private final Set&lt;Item&gt; selectedItems;

<li>Modern compilers often have library depenencies (e.g. cloog) that may have different behaviour in different versions, causing the compiler to make code generation decisions based on essentially other data</li>
<li>These libraries may (in some compiler versions) be optional at compile time (might need to give --enable switches to configure, or configure tries to autodetect them).</li>
<li>Compiler switches like <code>-march=native</code> will look on what hardware you compile and try to optimize accordingly.</li>

<pre><code>    String dateString = ""2019-11-27"";
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(dateString);
    int epochDay = (int) date.toEpochDay();

    System.out.println(epochDay);
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet outputs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>18227</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Epoch Day count is a simple incrementing count of days where day 0
  is 1970-01-01 (ISO).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my suggestion is that this number is fine for feeding into your <code>BarEntry</code> constructor.</p>

<p><code>toEpochDay()</code> returns a <code>long</code>. If your constructor doesn’t accept a <code>long</code>, convert to <code>int</code>. In the code above I did a simple cast. The risk is that we will get a very wrong result in case of <code>int</code> overflow for dates in the far future or the far past. I prefer to do a range check to avoid that:</p>

<pre><code>    long epochDayLong = date.toEpochDay();
    if (epochDayLong &lt; Integer.MIN_VALUE || epochDayLong &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(""Date "" + date + "" is out of range"");
    }
    int epochDay = (int) epochDayLong;
</code></pre>

<p>The result is the same as before. This check is the same check that the <code>Math.toIntExact</code> method I mentioned in a comment does (available from Android API level 24).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had converted this value <strong>18227</strong> to normal date and it gives date
  of this year <strong>1970/01/01</strong> and in JSON it's <strong>2019-11-27</strong> why? and
  how should i correct it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me guess, you effectively did <code>new Date(18227)</code>. My suggestion is that you avoid the <code>Date</code> class completely and stick to java.time, the modern Java date and time API. Why you got 1970 is: 18227 is a count of <em>days</em> since the epoch, and <code>Date</code> counts <em>milliseconds</em> (since 00:00 UTC on the epoch day). So you got 00:00:18.227 UTC on that day. We already have a <code>LocalDate</code> in the above code, so just use that.</p>

<pre><code>    System.out.println(date);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>2019-11-27</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should you need to convert the opposite way, it’s easy when you know how:</p>

<pre><code>    LocalDate convertedBack = LocalDate.ofEpochDay(epochDay);
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a <code>LocalDate</code> with the same value.</p>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>I would like to keep the order of the original data and not mix the data up or miss any observations.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the ""structure"" of the above lists however. The closest I have come to a solution is:</p>

<pre><code>f &lt;- function(x){
  r = rollapply(x, width = 5, FUN = print)
  return(r)
}

f(seq(1:30))

<hr>

<p>*(<em>I’ve re-edited my answer to give a more thorough workflow for installing/using older software versions with homebrew. Feel free to add a note if you found the old version better.</em>)</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest case:</p>

<h2>1) Check, whether the version is already installed (but not activated)</h2>

<p>When homebrew installs a new formula, it puts it in a versioned directory like <code>/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.1</code>. Only symbolic links to this folder are then installed globally. In principle, this makes it pretty easy to switch between two installed versions. (*)</p>

<p>If you have been using homebrew for longer and never removed older versions (using, for example <code>brew cleanup</code>), chances are that some older version of your program may still be around. If you want to simply activate that previous version, <code>brew switch</code> is the easiest way to do this.</p>

<p>Check with <code>brew info postgresql</code> (or <code>brew switch postgresql &lt;TAB&gt;</code>) whether the older version is installed:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew info postgresql
postgresql: stable 9.3.2 (bottled)
http://www.postgresql.org/
Conflicts with: postgres-xc
/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5 (2755 files, 37M)
  Built from source
/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2 (2924 files, 39M) *
  Poured from bottle
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
# … and some more
</code></pre>

<p>We see that some older version is already installed. We may activate it using <code>brew switch</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew switch postgresql 9.1.5
Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5
Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2
384 links created for /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s double-check what is activated:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew info postgresql
postgresql: stable 9.3.2 (bottled)
http://www.postgresql.org/
Conflicts with: postgres-xc
/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5 (2755 files, 37M) *
  Built from source
/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2 (2924 files, 39M)
  Poured from bottle
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
# … and some more
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the star <code>*</code> has moved to the newly activated version</p>

<p>(*) <em>Please note that <code>brew switch</code> only works as long as all dependencies of the older version are still around. In some cases, a rebuild of the older version may become necessary. Therefore, using <code>brew switch</code> is mostly useful when one wants to switch between two versions not too far apart.</em></p>

<h2>2) Check, whether the version is available as a tap</h2>

<p>Especially for larger software projects, it is very probably that there is a high enough demand for several (potentially API incompatible) major versions of a certain piece of software. As of March 2012, <a href=""https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Homebrew 0.9</a> provides a mechanism for this: <code>brew tap</code> &amp; the <a href=""https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">homebrew versions</a> repository.</p>

<p>That versions repository may include backports of older versions for several formulae. (Mostly only the large and famous ones, but of course they’ll also have several formulae for postgresql.)</p>

<p><code>brew search postgresql</code> will show you where to look:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew search postgresql
postgresql
homebrew/versions/postgresql8    homebrew/versions/postgresql91
homebrew/versions/postgresql9    homebrew/versions/postgresql92
</code></pre>

<p>We can simply install it by typing</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install homebrew/versions/postgresql8
Cloning into '/usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew-versions'...
remote: Counting objects: 1563, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (943/943), done.

Tapped 125 formula
==&gt; Downloading http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v8.4.19/postgresql-8.4.19.tar.bz2
# …
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this has automatically <em>tapped</em> the <code>homebrew/versions</code> tap. (Check with <code>brew tap</code>, remove with <code>brew untap homebrew/versions</code>.) The following would have been equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install postgresql8
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the backported version formulae stay up-to-date, this approach is probably the best way to deal with older software.</p>

<h2>3) Try some formula from the past</h2>

<p>The following approaches are listed mostly for completeness. Both try to resurrect some undead formula from the brew repository. Due to changed dependencies, API changes in the formula spec or simply a change in the download URL, things may or may not work.</p>

<p>Since the whole formula directory is a git repository, one can install specific versions using plain git commands. However, we need to find a way to get to a commit where the old version was available.</p>

<p><strong>a) historic times</strong></p>

<p>Between <strong>August 2011 and October 2014</strong>, homebrew had a <code>brew versions</code> command, which spat out all available versions with their respective SHA hashes. As of October 2014, you have to do a <code>brew tap homebrew/boneyard</code> before you can use it. As the name of the tap suggests, you should probably only do this as a last resort.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>$ brew versions postgresql
Warning: brew-versions is unsupported and may be removed soon.
Please use the homebrew-versions tap instead:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions
9.3.2    git checkout 3c86d2b Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.3.1    git checkout a267a3e Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.3.0    git checkout ae59e09 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.2.4    git checkout e3ac215 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.2.3    git checkout c80b37c Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.2.2    git checkout 9076baa Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.2.1    git checkout 5825f62 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.2.0    git checkout 2f6cbc6 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.1.5    git checkout 6b8d25f Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.1.4    git checkout c40c7bf Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.1.3    git checkout 05c7954 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.1.2    git checkout dfcc838 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.1.1    git checkout 4ef8fb0 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.0.4    git checkout 2accac4 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
9.0.3    git checkout b782d9d Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it advises against using it. Homebrew spits out all versions it can find with its internal heuristic and shows you a way to retrieve the old formulae. Let’s try it.</p>

<pre><code># First, go to the homebrew base directory
$ cd $( brew --prefix )
# Checkout some old formula
$ git checkout 6b8d25f Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
$ brew install postgresql
# … installing
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the older postgresql version is installed, we can re-install the latest formula in order to keep our repository clean:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -- Library/Formula/postgresql.rb
</code></pre>

<p><code>brew switch</code> is your friend to change between the old and the new.</p>

<p><strong>b) prehistoric times</strong></p>

<p>For special needs, we may also try our own digging through the homebrew repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core &amp;&amp; git log -S'8.4.4' -- Formula/postgresql.rb
</code></pre>

<p><code>git log -S</code> looks for all commits in which the string <code>'8.4.4'</code> was either added or removed in the file <code>Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/postgresql.rb</code>. We get two commits as a result.</p>

<pre><code>commit 7dc7ccef9e1ab7d2fc351d7935c96a0e0b031552

commit fa992c6a82eebdc4cc36a0c0d2837f4c02f3f422
Author: David Höppner

    postgresql: update version to 8.4.4
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, <code>fa992c6a82eebdc4cc36a0c0d2837f4c02f3f422</code> is the commit we’re interested in. As this commit is pretty old, we’ll try to downgrade the complete homebrew installation (that way, the formula API is more or less guaranteed to be valid):</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b postgresql-8.4.4 fa992c6a82eebdc4cc36a0c0d2837f4c02f3f422
$ brew install postgresql
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -d postgresql-8.4.4
</code></pre>

<p>You may skip the last command to keep the reference in your git repository.</p>

<p>One note: When checking out the older commit, you temporarily downgrade your homebrew installation. So, you should be careful as some commands in homebrew might be different to the most recent version.</p>

<h2>4) Manually write a formula</h2>

<p><a href=""https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap"" rel=""noreferrer"">It’s not too hard</a> and you may then upload it to your own repository. Used to be <a href=""https://docs.brew.sh/Versions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Homebrew-Versions</a>, but that is now discontinued.</p>

<h2>A.) Bonus: Pinning</h2>

<p>If you want to keep a certain version of, say postgresql, around and stop it from being updated when you do the natural <code>brew update; brew upgrade</code> procedure, you can <em>pin</em> a formula:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew pin postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Pinned formulae are listed in <code>/usr/local/Library/PinnedKegs/</code> and once you want to bring in the latest changes and updates, you can <em>unpin</em> it again:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew unpin postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, unfortunately I don't have the slightest idea of how docker works and what's going on, just that I need it. I'm running docker in Win10 Pro and to make matters even worst it is actually working for another dev running Win10. We tried a few things but we can't make it work. I tried cloning the repo in other locations with no success at all. Everything before this particular step runs correctly.</p>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>]</p>

<p>As suggested by the users I ran <code>RUN ls bin/</code> before the composer install line and this is the result:</p>

<p>As you can see <code>composer-install</code> is there so this is quite baffling.</p>

<p>Also I checked and set the line ending sequence to LF and the result is the same error.</p>

<p>[<strong>SECOND EDIT</strong>]</p>

<p>I added <code>COPY  bin/composer-install /bin</code>
Then <code>RUN ls bin/</code>
And the results are the same. The <code>ls</code> command finds the file but the error persists. Also adding a slash before bin doesn't change anything :(</p>

<p>If the sites are fairly temporary (i.e. you build it quickly, it gets used for a specific purpose and amount of time and then it is effectively closed) then banging out these sites in the most comfortable way for you is perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>If you have a long list of bugs, fixes and improvements that you now need (or would like) to backport to your old sites, or your ""small sites"" are getting bigger and more complidated and this is causing you significant grief then you need to take a step back and re-evaluate how you structure and support these sites.</p>

<p>I would very much agree that ASP.NET is a very much more mature and effective programming environment.  However, like any tool, you need to know (or learn) the right way to use it as it's not going to automatically turn you into a ""super programmer"" overnight.</p>

<p>A way to break the ice is to agree with your boss that the next ""site"" you create is developed in ASP.NET.  Explain to him that it will take quite a lot longer than how you currently deliver sites because you have to ""get your head around"" ASP.NET, but the benefits are x,y and (exercise left to the reader!)</p>

<p>Personally, I'm still in the transition phase (and I started using ASP.NET from v1!) as I have a fairly robust Classic ASP framework I'm developed and comfortable with.   However, I have used ASP.NET strategically and have found it VERY powerful and your do end up writing must less code, as so much is built into the .net framework, as long as you can find it in documentation.</p>

<p>I also recommend that you DONT use VB.NET and your bite the bullet to use C#.  The change of language is quite minor, but you reduce the chances of writing your sites exactly the same was as you used to. It helps break the bad habits annd gives you a chance to learn new techniques.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>If you prefer to trust the device time zone setting rather than a hard-coded (or configured) time zone, use <code>LocalTime.now(ZoneId.systemDefault())</code>.</p>

<p>Since <code>LocalTime</code> hasn’t got an <code>isBeforeOrEqual</code> method nor an <code>isEqualOrAfter</code>, I am putting the condition negatively: if the current time is neither strictly before nor strictly after the range, it must be within it. Some will prefer the longer but also more direct:</p>

<pre><code>    boolean inClosedRange = currentTime.equals(rangeBegin)
            || (currentTime.isAfter(rangeBegin) &amp;&amp; currentTime.isBefore(rangeEnd))
            || currentTime.equals(rangeEnd);

<p>You will notice how much simpler it still is than your code using <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and <code>Date</code>. I personally also find it clearer. I am using and recommending java.time, the modern Java date and time API.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

Usually I call mine something like <code>{projectname}-dev</code> or <code>{projectname}-puf</code>, to indicate the relation with <code>projectname</code>.</p>

<p>Both Firebase databases (Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore) are schemaless. So there is no way to copy the schema to your development project, because there is no schema to begin with. But often part of your business rules are encoded in the security rules of the database, which you can (and definitely should) port tothe development project.</p>

<p>For getting some data into your development project, I prefer to not have actual user data in my development project. So I typically start with dummy data, either entered through the Firebase console, but more commonly by running some custom node scripts.</p>

<p>If you want to backport specific data from the database for <em>testing</em> (which is more common for me than for development), I'd start with a backup of your database, then trim that data down on your development machine, and insert it into the database through its API.</p>

<p>First, this allows to keep the good old universal null like check pattern as always, so that we can't really need to forget about it, but also, to go on with the new technologies developments and so to conform to the new standard as we like to, and so to follow the new Java specifications as they come out.</p>

<p>This is also a ""not"" backward compatibility break, as in Android we can rely on some backporting dependencies to enable this before API level 24.</p>

<pre><code>// support for optionals
compile ""net.sourceforge.streamsupport:streamsupport:1.5.1""
</code></pre>

<p>And moreover, this permits to use chained operations, conditionality, ReactiveX and a Single value as we coders prefer to.</p>

<pre><code>    public Single&lt;Optional&lt;Model&gt;&gt; getMyModel(boolean offlineFallback) {

    return apiInterface.getModel()
            .map( model -&gt; {

                        databaseRepository.saveMyModel( serverMyModel );
                    }

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tData = [86,87,84,86]
</code></pre>

<p>The running averages are <code>86/1</code>, <code>(86+87)/2</code>, <code>(86+87+84)/3</code>, and <code>(86+87+84+86)/4</code>.</p>

<p>So, at each index, the running average is the running total, dividing by (index + 1).</p>

<p>You can get the running totals with <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate"" rel=""nofollow""><code>accumulate</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(accumulate(tData))

<p>And you can get the (1-based) indexes with <code>enumerate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate(accumulate(tData, start=1))
[(1, 86), (2, 73), (3, 257), (4, 343)]
</code></pre>

<p>So, just divide:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [total / index for index, total in enumerate(accumulate(tData, start=1))]

Currently, it works something like this, where the individual UIs are initialized lazily and are stored statically:</p>

<pre><code>class UIManager
{

public:
   UIManager();            // Constructor
   virtual ~UIManager();   // Destructor


   template &lt;typename T&gt;
   T *getUI()
   {
      static T ui();       // Constructs T, stores result in ui when
                           // getUI&lt;T&gt;() is first called
      return &amp;ui;    
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Called with:</p>

<pre><code>getUI&lt;NameEntryUI&gt;()-&gt;activate();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>getUI&lt;MenuUI&gt;()-&gt;render();
</code></pre>

<p>I am considering a design change that would allow me to have more than one player, hence more than one game window, hence more than one UIManager.  I want all my constructed ui objects to be cleaned up when the UIManager is deleted (currently, because the ui objects are static, they stick around until the program exits).</p>

<p>How can I rewrite the above to remove the ui objects when UIManager is killed?</p>

<p>======================================</p>

<p>Here is the solution I've implemented.  Early results are that it is working well.</p>

<p>Basically, I started with the idea suggested by Potatoswatter, which I liked because it was similar to an approach I had started then aborted because I didn't know about typeid(T).  I backported the code to use only C++98 features.  The key to the whole thing is typeid(T), which lets you map instantiated interfaces to their type in a consistent manner.</p>

<pre><code>class UIManager
{
   typedef map&lt;const char *, UserInterface *&gt; UiMapType;
   typedef UiMapType::iterator UiIterator;

   map&lt;const char *, UserInterface *&gt; mUis;

public:
   UIManager();            // Constructor
   virtual ~UIManager()    // Destructor
   {
      // Clear out mUis
      for(UiIterator it = mUis.begin(); it != mUis.end(); it++) 
         delete it-&gt;second;

      mUis.clear();
   }

   template &lt;typename T&gt;
   T *getUI()
   {
      static const char *type = typeid(T).name();

      T *ui = static_cast&lt;T *&gt;(mUis[type]);
      if(!ui)
         ui = new T();

      mUis[type] = ui;

      return ui;

<ol>
<li><p>The features available in the header files correspond to those documented for the specific Linux version.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel running during execution corresponds to <code>&lt;linux/version.h&gt;</code> during compilation</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally, I suggest <strong>not</strong> to rely on these two assumptions at all.</p>

<p>The first assumption fails primarily due to backports, e.g. in enterprise Linux versions based on ancient kernels. If you care about different versions, you probably care about them.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend utilizing the methods for checking for struct members and include files in build system, e.g. for CMake:</p>

<pre><code>CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(""struct perf_event_attr"" cap_user_time linux/perf_event.h HAVE_PERF_CAP_USER_TIME)
</code></pre>

<p><code>CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES</code> can also be useful.</p>

<p>The second assumption can fail for many reasons, even if the binary is not moved between systems; E.g. updating the kernel but not recompiling the binary or simply booting another kernel. Specifically <code>perf_event_open</code> fails with <code>EINVAL</code> if a reserved bit is set. This allows you to retry with an alternative implementation not using the requested feature.</p>

<p>In short, statically check for the feature instead of the version. Dynamically, try and retry the legacy implementation if it failed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stick to one version of Dojo and use it consistently.</li>
<li>Move modified code to your own namespace and include it from there.

<ul>
<li>Effectively it is a forking of an existing DojoX module. All code syncing and back porting is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the rest of Dojo &mdash; if it changes in such a way that it breaks your forked version, be ready to patch your module as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Copy modified files somewhere and include/require them before the original file is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate the latter technique imagine that there is one file I want to patch located in dojox/charting/abc.js:</p>

<pre><code>dojo.provide(""dojox.charting.abc"");
// the rest of the file
...
</code></pre>

<p>I can copy it to my directory as, say, my/patched_abc.js, and make it look like that:</p>

<pre><code>dojo.provide(""my.patched_abc"");
// now I include the rest of the file with my modifications

dojo.provide(""dojox.charting.abc"");
// the rest of the file
...
</code></pre>

<p>In my code that uses dojox.charting I include it like that:</p>

<pre><code>dojo.require(""my.patched_abc"");
// now I can include dojox.charting,
// which will use my patched dojox.charting.abc module

dojo.require(""dojox.charting.Chart2D"");
// the rest of the file
...
</code></pre>

<p>Just be careful to avoid circular ""require"" statements.</p>

<p>This technique works very well for backports and minor customizations. If your changes are more extensive than that, you should consider writing your own module.</p>

<p>Apparently the specific version of a particular package has been deleted from the archive and replaced with a slightly differently named patch version. For instance, the above error is looking for <code>libxml2_2.9.1+dfsg1-3ubuntu4.7_amd64.deb</code> but the version on the server is <code>libxml2_2.9.1+dfsg1-3ubuntu4.8_amd64.deb</code>.</p>

<p>Often this is solvable by removing the base image (<code>docker rmi ubuntu:14.04</code>) and rebuilding; the newly downloaded ubuntu image has the correct patch number and finds the right archive file. But even this doesn't always work -- probably due to a delay between a new minor upgrade to Ubuntu's dependency db and the deployment of that new <code>ubuntu:14.04</code> image onto Docker Hub.</p>

<p>We've tried using <code>apt-get</code> flags <code>--fix-missing</code> and <code>--fix-broken</code> and those don't consistently work either.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?</p>

Our daily development process, including automatic build and deploy, is all scripted and using Docker and it's not practical to hack around inside a Dockerfile every time a particular archive goes missing (then remove the hack after a few hours or days).</p>

Pretty much everything in OpenGL ES is present in OpenGL on the desktop (with the exception of some of the fixed-point stuff), so that code can stay the same.</p>

<p>The way that OpenGL is handled on the iPhone is via a Core Animation layer (CAEAGLLayer), rather than a specific view.  Therefore, you should be able to transfer that across to a Leopard-based desktop application, although you'll need to convert all references to EAGL classes to their OpenGL equivalent (EAGLContext to NSOpenGLContext, for example).  You could render into a CAOpenGLLayer that's displayed by itself, or use that layer to back a custom NSView.</p>

<p>The fundamental structure of a desktop Cocoa application will be different than a Cocoa Touch  one, but you should be able to start from one of the Xcode templates and add back in your components from the Cocoa Touch application.</p>

<p>Again, I haven't yet done this for my application, but it looks reasonably straightforward.</p>

<p>I am using and recommending java.time, the modern Java date and time API. The date-time classes that you used, <code>Calendar</code> and in particular <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>, were always poorly designed and are long outdated.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>I currently have a program that listens to a unix socket (using a processing.connection.Listener), accept connections and spawns a thread handling the request. At a certain point I want to quit the process gracefully, but since the accept()-call is blocking and I see no way of cancelling it in a nice way. I have one way that works here (OS X) at least, setting a signal handler and signalling the process from another thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>import processing
from processing.connection import Listener
import threading
import time
import os
import signal
import socket
import errno

# This is actually called by the connection handler.
def closeme():
    time.sleep(1)
    print 'Closing socket...'
    listener.close()
    os.kill(processing.currentProcess().getPid(), signal.SIGPIPE)

oldsig = signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, lambda s, f: None)

listener = Listener('/tmp/asdf', 'AF_UNIX')
# This is a thread that handles one already accepted connection, left out for brevity
threading.Thread(target=closeme).start()
print 'Accepting...'
try:
    listener.accept()
except socket.error, e:
    if e.args[0] != errno.EINTR:
        raise
# Cleanup here...
print 'Done...'
</code></pre>

<p>The only other way I've thought about is reaching deep into the connection (listener._listener._socket) and setting the non-blocking option...but that probably has some side effects and is generally really scary.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a more elegant (and perhaps even correct!) way of accomplishing this? It needs to be portable to OS X, Linux and BSD, but Windows portability etc is not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>:
Thanks all! As usual, ambiguities in my original question are revealed :)</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to perform cleanup after I have cancelled the listening, and I don't always want to actually exit that process.</li>
<li>I need to be able to access this process from other processes not spawned from the same parent, which makes Queues unwieldy</li>
<li>The reasons for threads are that:

<ul>
<li>They access a shared state. Actually more or less a common in-memory database, so I suppose it could be done differently.</li>
<li>I must be able to have several connections accepted at the same time, but the actual threads are blocking for something most of the time. Each accepted connection spawns a new thread; this in order to not block all clients on I/O ops.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding threads vs. processes, I use threads for making my blocking ops non-blocking and processes to enable multiprocessing.</p>

There's one I know is specifically applicable to 6.2, but I don't immediately know if it was fixed in 6.2 (I know it was fixed for 6.3 and later) - and if it was, I'm not sure that fix would be in the build you're running, since it's more than a year and a half old....</p>

<p>A quick test you might be able to use to see if you are affected by one of these issues is to change the locale of the server to fr_FR.  If you're affected, you should see the disable message on devices appearing in French - even if the locale of the device is set to an English locale.</p>

<p>If you are affected, the very first thing I would suggest would be to apply the latest 6.2 iFix and determine if this resolves the issue.  If it does not, please open a PMR and the support team will help determine if this is indeed a problem that was fixed in 6.3 but wasn't backported to 6.2, and will see if we can get that fix backported.</p>

I agree 100% that creating the <code>Array#mode</code> method is a good idea, however - this is Ruby, we don't need a library of functions that act on arrays, we can create a mixin that adds the necessary functions <em>into</em> the Array class itself.</p>

<p>But the <code>inject(Hash)</code> alternative uses a sort, which we also don't really need: we just want the value with the highest occurrence.</p>

<p>Neither of the solutions address the possibility that more than one value may be the mode. Maybe that's not an issue in the problem as stated (can't tell). I think I'd want to know if there was a tie, though, and anyway, I think we can improve a little on the performance.</p>

<p>The ""optimised"" mode3 took 60% of the time of the previous record-holder. Note also the multiple highest-frequency entries.</p>

<hr>

<p>A few months down the line, I noticed <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/412169/ruby-how-to-find-item-in-array-which-has-the-most-occurrences/1909239#1909239"">Nilesh's answer</a>, which offered this:</p>

<pre><code>def mode4
  group_by{|i| i}.max{|x,y| x[1].length &lt;=&gt; y[1].length}[0]
end
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work with 1.8.6 out of the box, because that version doesn't have <code>Array#group_by</code>. ActiveSupport has it, for the Rails developers, although it seems about 2-3% slower than <code>mode3</code> above. Using the (excellent) <a href=""http://github.com/marcandre/backports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backports</a> gem, though, produces a 10-12% <em>gain</em>, as well as delivering a whole pile of 1.8.7 and 1.9 extras.</p>

<p>The above applies to <strong>1.8.6</strong> only - and mainly only if installed on Windows. Since I have it installed, here's what you get from IronRuby 1.0 (on .NET 4.0):</p>

<pre><code>==========================   IronRuby   =====================================

mode1 (I didn't bother :-))
mode2                           4.265625   0.046875   4.312500 (  4.203151)
mode3                           0.828125   0.000000   0.828125 (  0.781255)

<p>So in the event that performance is super-critical, benchmark the options on your Ruby version and OS. <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YMMV</a>.</p>

The website is setup via blogdown/blogdown_hugo. </p>

<p>In the dataframe ""data_local_indices_m"" are the columns<br>
""value"" (which has the value for every date, which needs to be plotted),<br>
""data_date"" (contains the date of the time series),<br>
""country"" contains the country name (e.g. AUT) and<br>
""continent"" (e.g. Europe).</p>

<p>I want two dropdown menues to change the plotted graph:  </p>

<p>1st dropdown should contain the continents.
Based on the selected value in the 1st dropdown menue, in the 
2nd dropdown menue should only appear the countries which have this value.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<p>Dropdown1 (continent):<br>
 - Europe  (this value is selected)  </p>

<p>Dropdown2 (country):<br>
- GER<br>
- AUT<br>
- ITA<br>
...</p>

<p>I basically have the two dropdown menues with the respective content but I don't know how to make them dependent on each other.<br>
Furthermore, the whole thing needs to be variable:<br>
If a new country gets added it should automatically appear (in the dropdown ""country"" and if it has a new continent, this contient should be added in the dropdown ""continent"")</p>

<p>Managed to create two dropdowns with the respective labels, but they don't depend on each other.</p>

<p>I just leave the code below. It is a very pathetic approach but it creates at least dropdown fields (which are not depending on each other). Please feel free to provide a better example. Maybe use the code just as a basic idea.</p>

(It's called Resolver One, and it's a Pythonic spreadsheet). We are also hosting the Ironclad project (to run CPython extensions under IronPython) and that is going well (we plan to release a beta of Resolver One &amp; numpy soon).</p>

<p>The reason we chose IronPython was the .NET integration - our clients want 100% integration on Windows and the easiest way to do that right now is .NET. </p>

<p>We design our GUI (without behaviour) in Visual Studio, compile it into a DLL and subclass it from IronPython to add behaviour.</p>

<p>We have found that IronPython is faster at some cases and slower at some others. However, the IronPython team is very responsive, whenever we report a regression they fix it and usually backport it to the bugfix release. If you worry about performance, you can always implement a critical part in C# (we haven't had to do that yet).</p>

<p>If you have experience with C#, then IronPython will be natural for you, and easier than C#, especially for prototypes.</p>

<p>Regarding IronPython studio, we don't use it. Each of us has his editor of choice (TextPad, Emacs, Vim &amp; Wing), and everything works fine.</p>

"18958555","2013-09-23 11:52:10","2","","","","<p>I have developed some tools specifically for making this process easier with git, and last week I wrote <a href=""http://blog.adamspiers.org/2013/09/19/easier-upstreaming-with-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">an extensive blog post</a> about them.  In particular, the <code>git cherry-menu</code> command referenced in that post can accept an arbitrary list of commits to backport, so using <code>git log</code> and your favourite text editor, you could build a reasonably carefully selected list of commits which constitute the critical feature to be backported, and then run something like:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b release-2.0.y release-2.0.x
git cherry-menu cat commits-to-backport.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to kan's rebasing suggestion, except that the backporting process is more structured, and by using git notes under the hood, you get several handy extra features, including that all meta-data describing the process is persisted across multiple runs of <code>git cherry-menu</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, if you only have a handful of commits to backport, kan is right that you might as well just cherry-pick directly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think the accepted answer is slightly self-contradictory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The all idea of backporting features looks broken for me. Only critical and nondestructive changes should be backported. For features and improvements you have to create new branch and start stabilization period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because creating a new branch and starting a stabilization period is still backporting.  The only difference is which branch you decide to put the backported commits into!  You can either put them into the original <code>release-2.0.x</code> branch, or a different branch forked off it, like the <code>release-2.0.y</code> branch I suggested above.  It's generally safer / cleaner to do the latter (and I guess that's Ivan's point), but really that depends on how you organize your repositories and branches.  It still doesn't avoid the need to perform cherry-picking and potential conflict resolution though.</p>

<p>Rails updates at a pretty good clip, but you don't really need to update unless you need features or the rare security patch. As an example, I have a rails app running in our company right now that was coded about 2.5 years ago that only needed to have some work done to it once this year to upgrade it to a new version to be compatible with apache mod_rails, it was originally written against Rails 1.2 I believe. Of course, that was an intranet app which didn't have any security requirements. All in all, it's been pretty pain free. If I had kept using mongrel + mod_proxy it wouldn't have only needed to be updated once for a security patch. </p>

<p>Rails is pretty secure, vulnerabilities are fairly far between. There have been a few more Ruby vulnerabilities than Rails vulnerabilities if memory serves me right, but all in all it's pretty solid, and upgrading your ruby shouldn't break rails, especially if you use a distro that backports security fixes.</p>

"18982273","2013-09-24 12:58:03","17","","","","<p><strong>Originally</strong>: the simple answer was that you can't do it.  Android is Java 6 based, and (AFAIK) there is no backport of Java 7's <code>java.nio.file</code> classes to Android.</p>

<p>(That's not surprising.  Porting <code>java.nio.file</code> would entail significant changes to the Davlik VM's native code libraries.) </p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>: according to the Android <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/java/nio/file/package-summary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">javadocs</a>, support for the <code>java.nio.file</code> package was added to Android in API level 26.  That corresponds to the Oreo release which came out in August 2017.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you tell me that what API should I use for my requirements. ( My requirement is File operation like : Cut|copy|delete on files and directories); </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prior to Android 26, I suggest you just use the <code>java.io.File</code> class for things like making directories, renaming files, and so on, and then implement the ""higher level"" operations such as copying files and directory trees using <code>File.list()</code> and <code>FileInpuStream</code> or <code>FileOutputStream</code>.  You could possibly simplify some operations using classes such as the Apache commons <code>DirectoryWalker</code> <code>FileUtils</code> or Guava <code>Files</code>.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve here.  There are already existing ""file manager"" apps for Android.</p>

<p>Here are a few more ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could chain the choices together with yield to do an in order traversal of the permutations.  In other words, choose could build a set of nested iterators out of the options passed to it, and they would just yield to the next one in the chain. Exiting the enclosed block puts you right back after the yield; if you need more (e.g. failure reasons) you could raise and rescue.</li>
<li>A funky arrangement of the three 'r's (rescue, raise, and retry) might do it, again with the idea that choose is nesting the option bodies or embedding them in a nested structure.</li>
<li>If the options are cheap and side effect free, you might want to look at just producing all the permutations and iterating through them.</li>
<li>If they aren't side effect free, you may want to try some sort of pseudo-monad solution, where you lazily produce lambdas for each permutation.</li>
<li>More or less equivalent (but straying ever farther from your initial question) you might be able to assign them an index (easiest if you could determine the cardinality of each choice, but possible with a segmented index in any case) and iterate through the indexes.</li>
<li><a href=""http://timetobleed.com/fibers-implemented-for-ruby-1867/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fibers have been backported to 1.8.x</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>But all things considered, I think your best answer would be to wrap the functionality you want in a class or function, implement it with <a href=""http://www.rubycentral.com/book/ref_m_kernel.html#Kernel.callcc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>callcc</code></a>, and then do version detection in or around the definition of this as needed so that the right implementation is used in the right version of ruby.</p>

Usage example:</p>

<p>If you want to fail the test on any records with warning level, you can e.g. check against the captured records, filtered by level:</p>

However, there is a <a href=""https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/issues/2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">closed bug report on the archive repository</a> with a comment saying that <code>mix local.phx</code> should no longer be used, and that the correct way is to install it from hex, where <a href=""https://hex.pm/packages/phx_new/1.4.8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>1.4.8</code> is available</a>:</p>

<pre><code>mix archive.install hex phx_new

<p>I submitted a <a href=""https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/pull/3452"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pull request</a> to fix this, which has been merged and also back-ported to 1.4, so <code>local.phx</code> should use hex by default from the next release (probably version 1.4.9). It will still be necessary to call the above command manually if you're using a pre-1.4.9 version that doesn't include the fix. I added a note to the docs to explain this, which was backported to 1.4 but later removed from master, so I guess this answer will have to suffice after version 1.5 😊</p>

<p>Note that the <a href=""https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.4.8/installation.html#phoenix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phoenix installation guide</a> doesn't mention <code>local.phx</code> and correctly introduces the <code>archive.install hex phx_new</code> mix task above.</p>

<p>First problem is that this version was never ported to RISC-V by RISC-V team. They have 3.14 and 4.1 in <a href=""https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux</a>. So, to start it in RISC-V processor, you should repeat all porting of architecture-dependent part (<code>arch/</code> directory of the kernel). This is <em>very complex task</em>, even when there is some ported version for target CPU. You may backport some parts from 3.14, but 2.6.33 and 3.14 are different, there were several years of evolution between them.  (PORTING is not just COMPILING, it is task of writing 30 files without any errors, or with long debugging.)</p>

<p>Second problem is that LLVM can only fully build modern Linux kernel versions which has patches from <a href=""http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/</a> project. There were unsupported (and never-to-be-supported in clang/llvm) GCC extensions used in some parts of the kernel. Partial build was possible, but two-three components of older Linux can't be build with clang.</p>

<p>So, I really recommend you to used linux kernel version from RISCV team, and newer (4.1) is better.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://github.com/marcojakob/javafx-ui-sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">javafx-ui-sandbox</a> project you link to is obsolete and incompatible with later JavaFX versions under some circumstances.</p>

<p><em>How to fix it</em></p>

<p>I advise using <a href=""http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/"" rel=""nofollow"">ControlsFX</a> instead.  ControlsFX has all of the functions of the javafx-ui-sandbox (and more) and is built so that it does not clash with JavaFX system classes.  It is also a much more actively maintained and developed project. </p>

<p>If you cannot use the minimum Java 8 version required for the latest version of ControlsFX, there used to be a <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx-2.x-backport"" rel=""nofollow"">ControlsFX 2.x backport</a>, but it no longer has any relevant content.</p>

<p><em>Long and unnecessary explanation follows</em></p>

<p>javafx-ui-sandbox was a prototyping system that includes classes which clash with classes included in some Java distributions - which is why you get:</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: class ""javafx.scene.control.Dialogs""'s 
  signer information does not match signer information of other classes 
  in the same package.  
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening here is that you are including a javafx-ui-sandbox class (<a href=""https://github.com/marcojakob/javafx-ui-sandbox/blob/master/javafx-dialogs/src/javafx/scene/control/Dialogs.java"" rel=""nofollow"">javafx.scene.control.Dialogs</a>) in your a jar and signing it (probably you are using NetBeans and <a href=""http://forums.netbeans.org/ntopic23717.html"" rel=""nofollow"">have the checkbox to self-sign jars switched on</a>, but there are other ways you could be signing).  So you are signing your jars with a different certificate than Oracle used to sign the JavaFX jars.  The JavaFX jars include the bulk of the code in the javafx.scene.control package.  As part of some obscure rule of Java, you can't sign code in the same package with two different certificates or it will generate a security exception.</p>

<p>Likely you don't see the issue when you are executing within NetBeans because you aren't signing your application to execute it within the development environment, but when you build the jar file you are executing, you are also signing the jar file, at which point the jar won't work.</p>

<p>The easy fix for you is just to copy the javafx-ui-sandbox source into your project and change the package name from javafx.scene.control to something else (e.g. com.yourcompany.control).  That way the class packages won't clash with the default packages provided for the JavaFX system and you can sign your code (including the com.yourcompany.control.Dialogs class) without causing any issues.  But again, you are probably better off using the ControlsFX library instead. </p>

"56749114","2019-06-25 07:41:25","1","","","","<p>You tagged your question java-6. Yet I am presenting the modern answer using java.time, the modern Java date and time API. This is available in Java 6 through ThreeTen Backport (see the link at the bottom).</p>

<p>Depending on from where you got your <code>XMLGregorianCalendar</code> you may not need to have one. If I understood correctly, this class was used for representing dates and times in XML documents, where they are formatted like for example <code>2019-06-24T18:18:55.007+02:00</code>. This format is close enough to ISO 8601 that the classes of java.time can parse it directly, which we prefer:</p>

<pre><code>    Locale userLocale = Locale.forLanguageTag(""mt-MT""); // Maltese Malta
    DateTimeFormatter displayFormatter
            = DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle.SHORT)
                    .withLocale(userLocale);

    String fromXml = ""2019-06-24T18:18:55.007+02:00"";
    OffsetDateTime dateTime = OffsetDateTime.parse(fromXml);
    String formattedUtcDateTime = dateTime.withOffsetSameInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC)
            .format(displayFormatter);
    System.out.println(formattedUtcDateTime);
</code></pre>

<p>Output from this snippet is (tested in Java 1.7.0_67 with ThreeTen Backport version 1.3.6):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24/06/2019 16:18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that the formatting is for displaying to a user, I recommend using Java’s localized formats. I have chosen Maltese locale because it matches your requested format exactly. If your user is in a different locale, you should still consider the format of that locale.</p>

<h2>Converting from XMLGregorianCalendar</h2>

<p>If you got your <code>XMLGregorianCalendar</code> from a legacy API that you cannot afford to change just now, there are a number of options for converting it.</p>

<p>One is to get the string back from the <code>XMLGregorianCalendar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    XMLGregorianCalendar xmlgc = DatatypeFactory.newInstance()
            .newXMLGregorianCalendar(""2019-06-24T18:18:55.007+02:00"");
    String fromXml = xmlgc.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>Now the rest is as above. Pro: it’s short, and I don’t think there are any surprises in it. Con: To me formatting back into the original string and parsing it once more feels like the detour.</p>

<p>Another option goes through the outdated <code>GregorianCalendar</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>    GregorianCalendar gc = xmlgc.toGregorianCalendar();
    ZonedDateTime zdt = DateTimeUtils.toZonedDateTime(gc);
    String formattedUtcDateTime = zdt.toOffsetDateTime()
            .withOffsetSameInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC)
            .format(displayFormatter);
</code></pre>

<p>Pro: I think it’s the official conversion. Con: it’s a line longer, and as I said, it uses the poorly designed and long outdated <code>GregorianCalendar</code> class.</p>

"698424","2009-03-30 18:22:39","298","","","","<p>The <strong>trunk</strong> is the main line of development in a SVN repository.</p>

<p>A <strong>branch</strong> is a side-line of development created to make larger, experimental or disrupting work without annoying users of the trunk version. Also, branches can be used to create development lines for multiple versions of the same product, like having a place to backport bugfixes into a stable release.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>tags</strong> are markers to highlight notable revisions in the history of the repository, usually things like ""this was released as 1.0"".</p>

<p>See the HTML version of ""<a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Version Control with Subversion</a>"", especially <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.branchmerge.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chapter 4: Branching and Merging</a> or buy it in paper (e.g. from <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596510330"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amazon</a>) for an in-depth discussion of the technical details.</p>

<p>As others (e.g. Peter Neubauer below) the underlying implementation as <code>/tags</code> <code>/branches</code> and <code>/trunk</code> directories is only <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.importing.html#svn.tour.importing.layout"" rel=""noreferrer"">conventional</a> and not in any way enforced by the tools. Violating these conventions leads to confusion all around, as this breaks habits and expectations of others accessing the repository. Special care must be taken to avoid committing new changes into tags, which <strong>should</strong> be frozen.</p>

<p>I use <a href=""http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TortoiseSVN</a> but no Visual Studio integration. I keep the ""Check for modifications"" dialog open on the second monitor the whole time, so I can track which files I have touched.

<p>Python 2.2 is really ancient! At least for security reasons, they should upgrade (no more security fixes for 2.2 since May 30, 2003!).</p>

<p>Note that you can install several versions of Python in parallel. Just make sure you use ""/usr/bin/python25"" instead of ""/usr/bin/python"" in your scripts. To make sure all the old stuff is still working, after installing Python 2.5, you just have to fix the two symbolic links ""/usr/bin/python"" and ""/usr/lib/python"" which should now point to 2.5.

<li><p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>API</strong></a> is not a collection of code <em>per se</em> - it is more like a ""protocol"" specification how various parts (usually libraries) communicate with each other.

<li><p>A <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>package</strong></a> is a collection of python modules under a common namespace.

<li><p>A <strong>script</strong> is a single file of python code that is meant to be <em>executed</em> as the 'main' program.</p></li>

Then you can use that script as a pre-commit hook for parent.</p>

<p>As an aside, I see all too often submodules and subtrees being used simply as dependencies. If you aren't actively developing in the submodules within the parent project and backporting commits, then you should instead consider using a dependency package manager such as composer or npm.</p>

In their case, they should be using a package manager like npm. You have the opposite scenario. Instead of including these packages as a dependency, you should graft them into your parent project repository as a subtree. Then you can easily Google the steps for backporting commits to the subtree repository of your package clone, and finally open a pull request to the vendor.</p>

  <p>What is a DynamicClassAttribute</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <code>DynamicClassAttribute</code> is a descriptor that is similar to <code>property</code>.  <code>Dynamic</code> is part of the name because you get different results based on whether you access it via the class or via the instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>instance access is identical to <code>property</code> and simply runs whatever method was decorated, returning its result</p></li>
<li><p>class access raises an <code>AttributeError</code>; when this happens Python then searches every parent class (via the <code>mro</code>) looking for that attribute -- when it doesn't find it, it calls the class' metaclass's <code>__getattr__</code> for one last shot at finding the attribute.  <code>__getattr__</code> can, of course, do whatever it wants -- in the case of <code>EnumMeta</code> <code>__getattr__</code> looks in the class' <code>_member_map_</code> to see if the requested attribute is there, and returns it if it is.  As a side note: all that searching had a severe performance impact, which is why we ended up putting all members that did not have name conflicts with <code>DynamicClassAttribute</code>s in the Enum class' <code>__dict__</code> after all.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>and how do I use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You use it just like you would <code>property</code> -- the only difference is that you use it when creating a base class for other Enums.  As an example, the <code>Enum</code> from <code>aenum</code><sup>1</sup> has three reserved names:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>name</code></li>
<li><code>value</code></li>
<li><code>values</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>values</code> is there to support Enum members with multiple values.  That class is effectively:</p>

<pre><code>class Enum(metaclass=EnumMeta):

    @DynamicClassAttribute
    def name(self):
        return self._name_

    @DynamicClassAttribute
    def value(self):
        return self._value_

    @DynamicClassAttribute
    def values(self):
        return self._values_
</code></pre>

<p>and now any <code>aenum.Enum</code> can have a <code>values</code> member without messing up <code>Enum.&lt;member&gt;.values</code>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Disclosure:  I am the author of the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python stdlib <code>Enum</code></a>, the <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>enum34</code> backport</a>, and the <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aenum"" rel=""noreferrer"">Advanced Enumeration (<code>aenum</code>)</a>  library.</p>

"38092489","2016-06-29 07:00:10","6","","","","<p>Python now supports <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradual typing</a> via the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">typing module</a> and <a href=""http://mypy-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mypy</a>. The <code>typing</code> module is a part of the stdlib as of Python 3.5 and can be downloaded <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from PyPi</a> if you need backports for Python 2 or previous version of Python 3. You can install <code>mypy</code> by running <code>pip install mypy</code> from the command line.</p>

<p>In short, if you want to verify that some function takes in an int, a float, and returns a string, you would annotate your function like so:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(param1: int, param2: float) -&gt; str:
    return ""testing {0} {1}"".format(param1, param2)
</code></pre>

<p>If your file was named <code>test.py</code>, you could then typecheck once you've installed mypy by running <code>mypy test.py</code> from the command line.</p>

<p>If you're using an older version of Python without support for function annotations, you can use type comments to accomplish the same effect:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(param1, param2):
    # type: (int, float) -&gt; str
    return ""testing {0} {1}"".format(param1, param2)
</code></pre>

<p>You use the same command <code>mypy test.py</code> for Python 3 files, and <code>mypy --py2 test.py</code> for Python 2 files.</p>

<p>The type annotations are ignored entirely by the Python interpreter at runtime, so they impose minimal to no overhead -- the usual workflow is to work on your code and run mypy periodically to catch mistakes and errors. Some IDEs, such as PyCharm, will understand type hints and can alert you to problems and type mismatches in your code while you're directly editing.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you need the types to be checked at runtime (perhaps you need to validate a lot of input?), you should follow the advice listed in the other answers -- e.g. use <code>isinstance</code>, <code>issubclass</code>, and the like. There are also some libraries such as <a href=""https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enforce</a> that attempt to perform typechecking (respecting your type annotations) at runtime, though I'm uncertain how production-ready they are as of time of writing.</p>

<p>For more information and details, see the <a href=""http://mypy-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mypy website</a>, the <a href=""http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mypy FAQ</a>, and <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PEP 484</a>.</p>

"19312186","2013-10-11 07:07:06","2","","","","<p>If you want to just <em>join</em> each CSV row based on ID, then don't use a <code>DictReader</code>. Dictionary keys must be unique, but you are producing rows with multiple <code>EXECUTION_STATUS</code> and <code>RELEASE</code>, etc. columns.</p>

<p>Moreover, how will you handle ids where one or two of the input CSV files has no input?</p>

<p>Use regular readers and store each row keyed by filename. Make <code>fieldnames</code> a list as well:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
from collections import defaultdict

result = defaultdict(dict)
filenames = (""FR1.1.csv"", ""FR2.0.csv"", ""FR2.5.csv"")
lengths = {}
fieldnames = [""TEST_ID""]

for csvfile in filenames:
    with open(csvfile, 'rb') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        headers = next(reader, [])  # read first line, headers
        fieldnames.extend(headers[1:])  # all but the first column name
        lengths[csvfile] = len(headers) - 1  # keep track of how many items to backfill
        for row in reader:
            result[row[0]][csvfile] = row[1:]  # all but the first column

with open(""out.csv"", ""wb"") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(fieldnames)
    for id_ in sorted(result):
        row = [id_]
        data = result[id_]
        for filename in filenames:
            row.extend(data.get(filename) or [''] * lengths[filename])
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<p>This code stores rows per filename, so that you can later build a whole row from each file but still fill in blanks if the row was missing in that file.</p>

<p>The alternative would be to make column names unique by appending a number or filename to each; that way your <code>DictReader</code> approach could work too.</p>

<p>The above gives:</p>

<pre><code>TEST_ID, RELEASE , COMPILE_STATUS , EXECUTION_STATUS, RELEASE , COMPILE_STATUS , EXECUTION_STATUS, RELEASE , COMPILE_STATUS , EXECUTION_STATUS
FC/B_019.config , FR1.1 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED, FR2.0 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED, FR2.5 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED
FC/B_020.config , FR1.1 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED, FR2.0 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED, FR2.5 , COMPILE_PASSED , EXECUTION_PASSED
FC/B_021.config , FR1.1 , COMPILE_FAILED , EXECUTION_FAILED, FR2.0 , COMPILE_FAILED , EXECUTION_FAILED, FR2.5 , COMPILE_FAILED , EXECUTION_FAILED
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to base your order on one of the input files, then <em>omit</em> that input file from the first reading loop; instead, read that file while writing the output loop and use its first column to look up the other file data:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
from collections import defaultdict

result = defaultdict(dict)
filenames = (""FR2.0.csv"", ""FR2.5.csv"")
lengths = {}
fieldnames = []

for csvfile in filenames:
    with open(csvfile, 'rb') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        headers = next(reader, [])  # read first line, headers
        fieldnames.extend(headers[1:])  # all but the first column name
        lengths[csvfile] = len(headers) - 1  # keep track of how many items to backfill
        for row in reader:
            result[row[0]][csvfile] = row[1:]  # all but the first column

with open(""FR1.1.csv"", ""rb"") as infile, open(""out.csv"", ""wb"") as outfile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    headers = next(reader, [])  # read first line, headers

    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(headers + fieldnames)

    for row in sorted(reader):
        data = result[row[0]]
        for filename in filenames:
            row.extend(data.get(filename) or [''] * lengths[filename])
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<p>This does mean that any <code>TEST_ID</code> values <em>extra</em> in the other two files are ignored.</p>

<p>If you wanted to preserve all <code>TEST_ID</code>s then I'd use <code>collections.OrderedDict()</code>; new <code>TEST_ID</code>s found in the later files will be tacked onto the end:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
from collections import OrderedDict

result = OrderedDict(dict)
filenames = (""FR1.1.csv"", ""FR2.0.csv"", ""FR2.5.csv"")
lengths = {}
fieldnames = [""TEST_ID""]

for csvfile in filenames:
    with open(csvfile, 'rb') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        headers = next(reader, [])  # read first line, headers
        fieldnames.extend(headers[1:])  # all but the first column name
        lengths[csvfile] = len(headers) - 1  # keep track of how many items to backfill
        for row in reader:
            if row[0] not in result:
                result[row[0]] = {}
            result[row[0]][csvfile] = row[1:]  # all but the first column

with open(""out.csv"", ""wb"") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(fieldnames)
    for id_ in result:
        row = [id_]
        data = result[id_]
        for filename in filenames:
            row.extend(data.get(filename) or [''] * lengths[filename])
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>OrderedDict</code> maintains entries in insertion order; so <code>FR1.1.csv</code> sets the order for all keys, but any <code>FR2.0.csv</code> ids not found in the first file are appended to the dictionary at the end, and so on.</p>

<p>For Python versions &lt; 2.7, either install a backport (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1617078/ordereddict-for-older-versions-of-python"">OrderedDict for older versions of python</a>) or track the ID order manually with:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
from collections import defaultdict

result = defaultdict(dict)
filenames = (""FR1.1.csv"", ""FR2.0.csv"", ""FR2.5.csv"")
lengths = {}
fieldnames = [""TEST_ID""]

for csvfile in filenames:
    with open(csvfile, 'rb') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        headers = next(reader, [])  # read first line, headers
        fieldnames.extend(headers[1:])  # all but the first column name
        lengths[csvfile] = len(headers) - 1  # keep track of how many items to backfill
        for row in reader:
            id_ = row[0]
            # track ordering
            if id_ not in seen:
                seen.add(id_)
                ids.append(id_)
            result[id_][csvfile] = row[1:]  # all but the first column

There's no documentation provided so I'm not sure if it is complete, but need help getting it going. I need help making sure the virtualenv is complete with all dependencies, database, etc. </p>

<p>Project should be:
Python 2.7
Django 1.3
PostgreSQL</p>

<p>Looks lik I can get the virtualenv activated by:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd app
$ source bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>However, doesn't look like it's using Python from within the virtualenv:</p>

<pre><code>$ which python 
/usr/bin/python 
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>echo $PATH
/virtualenv/app/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin
</code></pre>

<p>$ pip freeze lists out global packages, not ones originating from within the virtualenv</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Here are the directories and files contained within the virtualenv:</p>

<p>Note that you really shouldn't be using <code>codecs.open()</code>; that's an older API from Python 2 that has many issues and has been made obsolete by the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>io</code> framework</a> introduced in Python 3 and backported to Python 2.

<p>What you get on Android I dare not tell, but you can try.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>FormatStyle.FULL</code> you may specify <code>.SHORT</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code> or <code>LONG</code> depending on how long of a format you want.</p>

<p>I am using ThreeTen Backport, the backport of java.time, the modern Java date and time API, to Java 6 and 7. For older Android (under API level 26) use the Android adaption of the same, ThreeTenABP. See the links at the bottom.</p>

<p>I use language tag <code>bn-BD</code> for Bangla (Bengali) as spoken in Bangladesh. You may also try <code>bn</code> alone if you don’t want to specify a country, or <code>bn-IN</code> for Bangla as spoken in India. It may or may not make a difference.</p>

Unfortunately, the obsolete Linux kernel 4.1 fails to compile with such gcc 8.3 and you would need to backport several patches to make that combination work. Plus note that OpenEmbedded is usually treating any warning as an error which you may also want to disable via compilation flags as otherwise, the number of patches required will be quite endless. Overall, the better approach may be to also properly adopt a later still supported Linux kernel like the toradex_4.14-2.0.x-imx we are now officially moving to in BSP 3.0b2.</p>

<li>If you have Latin-1 strings, you could just split the higher byte of the chars in the string (Charset does this too I think)</li>
<li>You could also split the work among multiple cores if you have more (the fork-join framework had backport to 1.5 once)</li>
<li>You could also build the data into a stringbuilder and only convert it to byte array once at the end.</li>
<li>Look at your GC/memory usage. Too much memory utilization might slow your algorithms down due frequent GC interruptions</li>

<ul>
<li>antlr can probably go. Spring bundles its own copy in its own JARs</li>
<li>aopalliance - same reason</li>
<li>aspectj - are you using aspectJ from Spring? If not, ditch it.</li>
<li>backport - might be ok to get rid of it, try and see</li>
<li>cglib - some appservers already have this, so you might be able to get rid of it from the app</li>
<li>commons-codec - probably not needed</li>
<li>commons-httpclient - shouldn't necessary</li>
<li>commons-logging - already included in most appservers, shouldn't be needed</li>
<li>concurrent.jar - this is an old version of the java5 concurrent API, get rid of it.</li>
<li>h2.jar - no idea what this is</li>
<li>jackson - this is a JSON library. If you don't use JSON, you don't need this</li>
<li>org.springframework.aop - dump it unless you're using AOP</li>
<li>org.springframework.aspects - dump it unless you're using AOP</li>
<li>org.springframework.jdbc - dump it unless you're using JDBC</li>
<li>org.springframework.jms - dump it unless you're using JMS</li>
<li>org.springframework.transaction - dump it unless you're using transactions</li>
<li>spring-security - are you using this stuff?</li>

"1025255","2009-06-22 02:01:56","14","","","","<p>You need to be more specific.  Thrive in what context?</p>

<p>I think Scala's community is near the critical mass that it needs to be a self-sustainable open source project even if its primary institutional backer, the EPFL, suddenly had a change of heart; and there is currently every sign that it will reach this critical mass.  I think Scala will be with us and actively maintained for a long time.</p>

<p>A more pressing issue if the type of uses for which it is suited.  The Scala compiler and standard library are far from perfect.  When you start pushing the language or a portion of the library there is still a decent chance that you will find bugs.  This is improving by leaps and bounds, but it in itself isn't the core of the problem.</p>

<p>The problem is in order to get fixes you pretty much have to upgrade to the next version of Scala as upgrades come out.  The problem with that is that most version upgrades contain breaking changes, thus in order to obtain fixes you are likely to have to change your own code.  There's also the binary incompatibility problem, which means all your Scala dependencies have to change versions, too.</p>

<p>This could be severe problem if you have a lot of dependencies on other Scala libraries (unlikely - there aren't many yet), if you are subject to severe infrastructure bureaucracy, or worse, you're a product-oriented company that needs to distribute fixes to customer with severe infrastructure bureaucracy.</p>

<p>In order for Scala to be viable in such situations long-term, someone will have to start back porting fixes to earlier versions so that people don't have to perform breaking upgrades just to get some fixes.  I'm sure this will happen, because it really wouldn't be that hard, but it will probably require someone seeing a business opportunity, because let's face it, backporting changes and doing regression testing isn't exactly exiting work. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=7""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Microsoft also provides this tag to be either added into the HTTP header or the site's header:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=EmulateIE7""/&gt;

<p>Microsoft has more information on using the tag on the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/readiness/developers-new.aspx#versioning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">developer readiness</a> page.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the entire IE7 rendering engine is left intact in IE8, so sites can just add in those headers and have it drop down to the IE7 mode.  However, changes were made to the DOM and for security that were not backported to IE7, so the transition isn't perfect.  </p>

I noticed that my date/time calculations are off by 12 hours. It seems like <code>Sys.Date()</code> ignores the system timezone and defaults to UTC although system timezone is set accurately.</p>
<p>Help for <code>Sys.Date()</code> states the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>Sys.time returns an absolute date-time value which can be converted to various time zones and may return different days.</p>
<p>Sys.Date returns the current day in the current <strong>time zone</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I check the system timezone I can see it is correctly set.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Sys.timezone()
[1] &quot;Pacific/Auckland&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, <code>Sys.getlocale()</code> returns the following. It seems like everything is fine here too.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Sys.getlocale()
[1] &quot;LC_COLLATE=English_New Zealand.1252;LC_CTYPE=English_New Zealand.1252;LC_MONETARY=English_New Zealand.1252;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=English_New Zealand.1252&quot;

<p>Getting timezone of <code>Sys.Date()</code> using <code>lubridate::tz()</code> returns the following.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; lubridate::tz(Sys.Date())
[1] &quot;UTC&quot;

<p>And, converting the <code>Sys.Date()</code> to a <code>POSIXct</code> confirms that the original timezone of <code>Sys.Date()</code> despite accurately set system timezone is UTC.</p>

<p>which is considerably uglier. Another alternative is to use the preprocessor with <a href=""http://www.boost.org/libs/preprocessor/doc/ref/repeat.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>BOOST_PP_REPEAT</code></a>. I'm not sure myself which solution looks best, though I think I'd favor the first as it's better prepared for C++14 upgrading:</p>

<p>With <code>java.util.Date</code> you can’t. Despite the class name a <code>Date</code> does not represent a date. It is a point in time. So when the JVM’s default time zone may have changed since the <code>Date</code> was created, there is no way to detect which time zone was used when the <code>Date</code> was created. You can try all possible time zones, of course. This will typically give you two, occasionally three possible dates. Because it is never the same date in all time zones.</p>

<p>It may not be so bad as it sounds since the <code>Date</code> class is poorly designed and long outdated, so you shouldn’t use it anymore anyway.</p>

<h2>Solution: java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>java.time, the modern Java date and time API, offers the <code>LocalDate</code> class. A <code>LocalDate</code> is a date without time of day and without time zone. So when you create a <code>LocalDate</code> worth Jan 01, 1960, it will always unambiguously be Jan 01, 1960.</p>

<pre><code>    LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1960, Month.JANUARY, 1);
    System.out.println(date);
</code></pre>

<p>There is nothing mysterious about the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1960-01-01</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the first suggestion is to base your custom <code>DatePicker</code> class on <code>LocalDate</code> rather than <code>Date</code>.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford to make that change right now, the short-term solution is to convert just before calling <code>setDate</code> (so only after the last change of default time zone has happened):</p>

<pre><code>    Instant startOfDayInDefaultZone = date.atStartOfDay(ZoneId.systemDefault())
            .toInstant();
    Date oldFashionedDate = DateTimeUtils.toDate(startOfDayInDefaultZone);
    System.out.println(oldFashionedDate);
</code></pre>

<p>Output in my time zone was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 CET 1960</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above code I am using the <code>DateTimeUtils</code> from the backport for converting from <code>Instant</code> to <code>Date</code>. If your Android version has java.time built in, instead use <code>Date.from(startOfDayInDefaultZone)</code> for this conversion.</p>

My goal is to modify kernel to make ibss mode possible on 5GHz bandwith. Basically it is impossible, but I read that if I change kernel from current (3.18) to patched by Candela Tech (3.17) I will be able to install ath10k firmware, which will make my task possible. I am total newbie in those things and actually I don't really know what I should do. I have read many topics on the internet, but none of them helped me enough. </p>

<p>And now what I have done as far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded 3.17 kernel from Candela Tech website.</li>
<li>Downloaded the latest backports from some other website.</li>
<li>Also obtained adequate OpenWRT SDK (15.05).</li>
</ol>

<p>In Kernel directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp configs/ct-x64.cfg .config
$ make -j8 deb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-ct
</code></pre>

<p>It made 5 packages, which only 3 of them were required. But the problem was that those packages were too big. So actually it was the end of my journey, because size of router's HDD wasn't big enough.</p>

<p>Before I found out, that to make my goal possible, my router needs patched kernel, I had tried to cross-compile backports with using SDK build-in kernel. In backports directory I executed:</p>

<pre><code>$ make defconfig-ath10k
$ make menuconfig ----&gt; here I disabled CFG80211 and MAC80211
$ make -j3

Those variables were ofc in one line in every above step

<p>Predictability, stability and security, mostly.</p>

<p>The NPM archives are open, meaning everyone can submit changes, also unstable ones, or those introducing security loopholes in your app. When only a proven selection of stable and secure modules is available to your app, you run less risk of hacking.</p>

<p>The concept is similar to Debian's Stable distribution, which doesn't change packages for years and just backports security fixes.</p>

<p>Here's the issue, quoting from Ned Deily, writing on the <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-October/129832.html"">python-dev email list</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Tuesday, Apple released OS X 10.9 (a.k.a. Mavericks).   There has already 
  been a lot of interest in it, in part because Apple has made it available for 
  free and has made it easy for users with 10.8, 10.7, and (most) 10.6 systems 
  to upgrade directly to 10.9.  Unfortunately, there are issues with our current 
  maintenance releases (3.3.2 and 2.7.5) on OS X 10.9 that call for new 
  maintenance releases as soon as possible.</p>
  
  <p>One is critical in that it causes the interpreter to crash when running in 
  interactive mode (<a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue18458"">http://bugs.python.org/issue18458</a>).  The problem was due to 
  a long-standing compatibility issue in libedit's readline compatibility layer 
  that upstream has finally fixed and Apple has now shipped in 10.9.  Because 
  the python.org installers dynamically link to libedit, the original workaround 
  in readline.c for the original design flaw in history indexing now causes a 
  segfault on 10.9 when the user types in the second command interactively.  Not 
  good.  Ronald devised a fix that allows readline.so at runtime to detect and 
  work with either version of libedit so that we continue to have binary 
  compatibility across multiple OS X releases.  That fix is already out in the 
  3.4.0 alphas and backported to the 3.3 and 2.7 branches, awaiting release 
  there.  Just in the last 12 hours, there have been at least four duplicates of 
  the issue reported by users.  I've updated the original issue to explicitly 
  mention 10.9, now that it is no longer under NDA, and to provide a 
  downloadable script for inexperienced users to workaround the problem by 
  ""removing"" readline.so.  Presumably, as word gets out, there will be fewer 
  duplicate issues opened but the impact will remain.</p>

"57158057","2019-07-23 06:39:11","1","","","","<h2>java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>This will give you the output that you asked for, <code>2019-07-23</code> (with correct month number, 07, and with leading zero):</p>

<pre><code>onDateSetListener = new DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener() {
        @Override
        public void onDateSet(DatePicker view, int year, int month, int dayOfMonth) {
            LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month + 1, dayOfMonth);
            String dateString = date.toString();
            System.out.println(dateString);
        }
    };
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <code>LocalDate</code> from java.time, the modern Java date and time API. We need to add one to the month because <code>DatePicker</code> confusingly counts months from 0 for January through 11 for December, while <code>LocalDate</code> numbers months the same way humans do. <code>LocalDate.toString()</code> produces the <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> format you asked for. It conforms with ISO 8601.</p>

<h2>What went wrong in your code?</h2>

<p>First because, as mentioned, <code>DatePicker</code> numbers months from 0, you got the wrong month, 6 for July, so it was printed as June in your output. Second, formatting the date into a string, parsing it into a <code>Date</code> and printing that <code>Date</code> as a string is over-complicating things. Also <code>Date.toString()</code> always produces the format you saw, <code>EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy</code>. To produce a different string from that you would have needed to format it explicitly.</p>

<p>In any case both <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and <code>Date</code> are poorly designed and long outdated. And the modern date and time API is so much nicer to work with. I recommend it warmly.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>I removed the Cobertura plugin from Sonar, and that fixed the build issue but now I have no coverage. The weird thing is is that the plugin is no longer listed in the ""updatecenter/available"" admin page in Sonar!</p>

<p>Any ideas where its gone or what we're doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>So each action expects its own template. If I understand you correctly, you want two different ations to use the same Fluid-Template. You can achieve this in two different ways:</p>
<h3>1. Use Partials:</h3>
<p>Just put your hole Fluid-Template of action A to a partial and render that partial in the template for acion A and action B with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;f:render partial=&quot;YourPartial&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So you have two templates, but both are rendering the same partial.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Set the template for action B to be the template of action A:</h3>
<p>You can overwrite the default template of an action with:</p>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;view-&gt;setTemplatePathAndFilename($templatePathAndFilename);
</code></pre>
<p>You need to give the full path to a template file. Then Fluid will use this template instead of the default one.</p>
<p><em>Note: The 2nd suggestion is woking in TYPO3 CMS, but since extbase is backportet from flow, it should be possible to do this in flow as well.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The docker - jvm integration is a big improvement in Java 10.<br>
  It is really to do with setting sane XMS and the number of processors. These now respect the docker container limits rather than picking up the host instance values (you can turn this feature off using <code>-XX:-UseContainerSupport</code> depending on your use case). </p>
  
  <p>I have not found it helpful in dealing with the page cache though.<br>
  The best solution I have found is to disable the docker memory limit, after the container is created if need be.<br>
  This is definitely a hack - user beware. </p>

<p>Since you’ve got a working solution using java.time and since <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> is causing trouble (not only for you: it is <em>notoriously</em> troublesome), I suggest that you use the backport of java.time. It has been adapted to Android in the ThreeTenABP project. See the links at the bottom.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking only the central and most used parts of java.time have been backported. However, that covers all that is used in at least 99 % of programs that use java.time, and I am sure that the solution that you have will work unchanged on the backport too. When I say <em>unchanged</em>, one change is necessary: you must import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</p>

<p>In case you do insist on doing without the backport I also include links to questions about parsing ISO 8601 format. ISO 8601 is an international standard and this is the format you have got. Be aware, however: There is no way whatsoever that <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> can correctly parse 6 decimals on the seconds. It supports only milliseconds, exactly three decimals (not 2, not 4, not 6).</p>

"57402235","2019-08-07 21:00:11","1","90","<git><github>","Git branching strategy for programming exercises?","<p>I’m working an extensive tutorial to learn a new software framework. The product is in some flux, so it’s not uncommon for the tutorial to be updated.¹ </p>

<p>My needs are:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can keep the original exercises without solutions (normally consisting of a subdirectory of the repo named <code>problem-NN</code>, with a <code>README.md</code> describing the problem, some data files, a test or two, a code skeleton, and perhaps some utility libraries) pristine;</li>
<li>I can track my work in progress on a given exercise in a local branch;</li>
<li>When I complete an exercise, I sometimes create a replica branch which I interactively rebase to make the commit history capture the important learning points I may want to review later and remove dead-ends, and which I sometimes upload to GitHub for feedback (but I leave the original WIP commits around just in case I want to refer to them just for my own personal use);</li>
<li>Sometimes (but not always) later problems build on the solutions of previous ones, so hard-resetting back to the origin master before beginning each new problem isn’t always possible; and</li>
<li>If a change to the origin master happens after I’ve solved a given problem, I need to save my solution at the time I solved it based on the origin’s state at that time—even if I also have to modify it for use in a later problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve usually started each new exercise by creating a new branch like, say, <code>problem-05</code> based on either <code>master</code> (if the exercise has no dependencies) or on <code>problem-03-solved</code> (if it has dependencies); when I complete a solution, I create a <code>problem-05-solved</code> branch (which, usually, remains an alias for the <code>problem-05</code> branch, but gives me a place to diverge if I need to for later problems or for incorporating upstream changes). I create yet another branch, <code>problem-05-public</code>, if I want to push a solution up to my fork for feedback.</p>

<p>The biggest issue here (without which this would just be a “create branches however you like” situation) is when these updates to the tutorial are pushed to the upstream origin (often to harmonize the tutorial with a new version of the framework it’s teaching).</p>

<p>The use case is a bit like <a href=""https://exercism.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exercism.io</a>, but while exercism.io is Git-based, it uses its own software to manage the repo checkout, and is organized with different goals in mind.</p>

<p>If there’s a direct analogue to a typical software development lifecycle here, I’m not sure what it is (though it seems to resemble both hotfixing and backporting).</p>

<p>When a new tutorial update comes out, I need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Merge² the changes into my “unsolved” or pristine branch(es)—which, for now, are just my local <code>master</code>;</li>
<li>If the changes affect the problem I’m currently working on, <em>or</em> a prior problem this problem builds upon, incorporate those changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Doing this once is easy—or at least, as easy as possible depending on how hard actually incorporating the newest set of changes into my solutions is. Doing it successive times when later updates come out, however, is harder, since I’d like not to have to duplicate a lot of “porting” I already did to make my solution work with, say, v1.2 of the tutorial when I incorporate the changes in v1.3.</p>

<p><code>git-rerere</code> seems to be applicable here; I already have the rerere-related variables enabled and know how to use it (for simple cases, anyway).</p>

<p>So: how to best organize my branches to be prepared for the origin churn over time?</p>

<p>I know this is a bit of a judgment call without a single “right” answer, but I don’t think it’s so subjective to be off-topic for Stack Overflow—I think there <em>is</em> a way to design the branching/merging workflow to minimize work here.</p>

<p>I have later tutorials to work on and I have colleagues who haven’t started this one yet, so while a solution that will be difficult to incorporate at this late stage is suboptimal, it would still be appreciated.</p>

<p><hr/>
¹ I’m learning the software, not writing the tutorial. I’ve contributed things like typo fixes before, so I may have some ability to suggest changes to the tutorial’s repo design. But while I could fork it and maintain a fork (I already <em>have</em> a fork, for the purposes of sharing my solutions, but I mean a fork of the unsolved tutorial), you can assume my ability to make changes to the way the tutorial itself is structured is limited. </p>

<p>² When I say “merge” here, I mean it in the English sense; I’m using the word whether the operation is carried out through Git merging, rebasing, or even manually patching. </p>

When analyzing the issue, we figured that there were two python paths for dist-packages, <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/backports</code> and <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/backports</code>. </p>

"20055495","2013-11-18 18:51:06","4","","","","<p>The easy way to do this is with threads. The nearly-as-easy way is with <code>gevent</code> or a similar library (and <a href=""https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests"" rel=""nofollow""><code>grequests</code></a> even ties <code>gevent</code> and <code>requests</code> together so you don't have to figure out how to do so). The hard way is building an event loop (or, better, using something like Twisted or Tulip) and multiplexing the requests yourself.</p>

<p>Let's do it the easy way.</p>

<p>You don't want to run 100000 threads at once. Besides the fact that it would take hundreds of GB of stack space, and your CPU would spend more time context-switching than running actual code, the service only supports 20 connections at once. So, you want 20 threads.</p>

<p>So, how do you run 100000 tasks on 20 threads? With a thread pool executor (or a bare thread pool).</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/concurrent.futures.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>concurrent.futures</code></a> docs have an <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor-example"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a> which is almost identical to what you want to do, except doing GETs instead of POSTs and using <code>urllib</code> instead of <code>requests</code>. Just change the <code>load_url</code> function to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def load_url(token):
    deviceToken=token[0].replace(""/"","""")
    # … your original code here …
    r = requests.post(URL, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
    return r.content
</code></pre>

<p>… and the example will work as-is.</p>

<p>Since you're using Python 2.x, you don't have the <code>concurrent.futures</code> module in the stdlib; you'll need the backport, <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures"" rel=""nofollow""><code>futures</code></a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>In Python (at least CPython), only one thread at a time can do any CPU work. If your tasks spend a lot more time downloading over the network (I/O work) than building requests and parsing responses (CPU work), that's not a problem. But if that isn't true, you'll want to use processes instead of threads. Which only requires replacing the <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> in the example with a <code>ProcessPoolExecutor</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to do this entirely in the 2.7 stdlib, it's nearly as trivial with the thread and process pools built into the <code>multiprocessing</code>. See <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers"" rel=""nofollow"">Using a pool of workers</a> and the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool"" rel=""nofollow"">Process Pools</a> API, then see <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.dummy"" rel=""nofollow""><code>multiprocessing.dummy</code></a> if you want to use threads instead of processes.</p>

<h2>Implicit printing works correctly</h2>

<p>I'm trying to print an HTML table based on a data frame containing Unicode characters, as represented by this simple example:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: ""Unicode Print Test""
---

```{r, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(data.frame(eta=""\U03B7""), format=""html"")
```
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the output I want when the document is knitted to HTML, shown below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/axbGV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/axbGV.png"" alt=""correct_table_output""></a></p>

<h2>Explicit printing does not</h2>

<p>But in the real application, I need to print several tables from inside a <code>for</code> loop, meaning I have to explicitly <code>print()</code> the table:</p>

<pre><code>```{r, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
x &lt;- knitr::kable(data.frame(eta=""\U03B7""), format=""html"")
print(x)
```
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the Unicode character is not printed correctly when the document is knitted to HTML:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xaDe0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xaDe0.png"" alt=""incorrect_table_output""></a></p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>

<p>Why does this difference between implicit and explicit printing occur? At least when executed in the R console, both explicit and implicit printing calls the <code>knitr:::print.knitr_kable()</code> function. I'm would guess it has something to do with the <code>evalaute</code> function (from the package of the same name) which actually executes the code in knitr code chunks, but I can't figure out what.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can have my explicit <code>print()</code> calls and get the correctly formatted output? I am aware of this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17715956/why-do-some-unicode-characters-display-in-matrices-but-not-data-frames-in-r"">locale workaround</a> which seems to work for some other Unicode + Data Frame issues, but not this one.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: According to a knowledgeable commenter, this is a deep issue related to how and when R converts characters using the native Windows encoding prior to display. So, this is always going to be an issue when using the <code>print</code> function when on Windows, unless base R changes significantly.</p>

<p>Updated question: Are there any other methods (besides <code>print()</code>-ing) for getting a <code>kable</code> object to display from inside expressions such as for-loops?</p>

<p>1) Have you printed out the pathfiles? Are you sure that they are all properly generated?</p>

<p>a) I ask as your os.walk is a bit interesting; the dirs.sort() should be ok, but seems quite unncessarily.  os.chdir() in general shouldn't be used; the restoration <strong>should</strong> be alright, but in general you should just be appending root to init.</p>

<p>2) I've seen multiprocessing on python2.6 have problems spawning subporcesses from pools.  (I specifically had a script use multiprocessing to spawn subprocesses.  Those subprocesses then could not correctly use multiprocessing (the pool locked up)).  Try python2.5 w/ the mulitprocessing backport.</p>

<p>3) Try <a href=""http://www.picloud.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">picloud</a>'s cloud.mp module (which wraps multiprocessing, but handles pools a tad differently) and see if that works.  </p>

I want to start compiling it with 1.6 class format, but there is one problem which reveals itself only when I try to run the compiled code. I get the following exception:</p>

<p>java.lang.ClassFormatError: Illegal class modifiers in class FooBar 0x209</p>

<p>Googling this doesn't reveal a lot of details. According to <a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6521576"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> the issue might be related to mismatch between interface and implementation modifiers. And of course, it must be some new restriction which wasn't in 1.5. </p>

<p>The problematic is class huge and has a lot of inner classes and inner inner classes so the problem is hard to track down (it's one of the inner classes I'm sure). Needless to say, the class doesn't have any tests either so changing it requires extreme caution and is laborous.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any exact information about 0x209 - what does the code mean specifically?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>Thanks to Arne bumping us into the right direction we were able to track down the issue and make a workaround. The root cause is not quite clear but now we can avoid it. </p>

<p>We are using Doug Lea's ancient <a href=""http://g.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">util.concurrent package</a> in certain areas because some components are running in environments which only provide Java 1.1 (yes, it
's quite alright to laugh, I don't mind). </p>

<p>This same code (using the concurrent utils) is also used as a small component of another related software. Since Doug's code used some 1.2 features, we were also forced to modify certain parts of util.concurrent to make it 1.1 compatible with Sun's 1.1 backported collections package (can't find the link to those any more). Somehow it has caused this peculiar Eclipse compilation behavior which occurs when we change the class format to Java 1.6. This is the minimum code which causes the problem:</p>

<pre><code>EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import com.sun.java.util.collections.Map;

public class FooBar
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map.Entry e = (Map.Entry)(new ConcurrentHashMap().entrySet().iterator().next());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After you compile this with Eclipse (with compilation set to 1.6, 1.5 works fine) and try to load the class from Sun's 1.6 JRE the problem occurs. The workaround: instead of looping through entries, we loop through keys and get values inside the loops with the keys.</p>

<p>Our setup here is so exotic that no wonder nobody else has bumped into this. I finally checked our build scripts and lo and behold, the ant-script has 1.6 source and target-settings. So apparently this is Eclipse-specific.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>

<p>I Looked closer to the Sun bug report I have linked here. The problem there is also related to com.sun.java.util.collections.Map.Entry. And that occurred with Sun's Javac. Interesting.</p>

  <p>Are WinForms dead or dying? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. It is not significantly developed further (i.e. no new <em>major</em> additions), but it is fully supported in .NET 4, for example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is WPF a good technology to learn? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it the future, just a phase, or a technology that can walk hand-in-hand alongside WinForms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is intended that you eventually move over to WPF, but it is also understood that there are large existing codebases written in WinForms, and there's no business case for rewriting them in WPF. Hence WinForms remains supported.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, any experiences will be good to hear, especially from people who have used both extensively. How did you find implementing a similar feature in both frameworks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broadly speaking, WPF is much more expressive. If you look at frameworks as set of Lego bricks that can be put together in various ways, WinForms bricks are much larger - each one does a lot - and therefore there are fewer ways to put them all together. Quite often, when you need something-but-not-quite like what an existing brick does, you have to write your own from scratch. In WPF, the bricks are significantly smaller, and can be combined in many interesting and even surprising ways.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider how WPF <code>Button</code> is a container that can host arbitrary content - not just image+text as in WinForms, but absolutely any other WPF control or set of controls.</p>

<p>WPF is also much easier to write dynamic layouts in compared to WinForms. The latter has layouts, too, but the problem is that they're a royal PITA to work with in visual designer, and writing WinForms component initialization by code is very tedious. With WPF, you just write XAML markup by hand, and layouts (and control trees in general) are very naturally represented in XML.</p>

<p>Partially stemming from the above, I find that WPF is easier to localize. For one thing, it's because you really do need dynamic layouts for localizability (since you don't know in advance the length of the strings in all locales). WinForms solution to this is to consider not only text labels, but also control position and size, as ""localizable property"" - so the translator is supposed to rearrange controls on the form himself if he finds that strings don't fit. In WPF, dynamic layouts are the default approach, so localizer just deals with strings. </p>

<p>WPF binding framework is rather powerful (even if verbose, thanks to lack of inline converters), and heavily promotes MVP, and, in general, model/view separation. This is possible to achieve with WinForms in 2.0+, and I try to do that there as well, but it's more tedious, especially with respect to null handling, and sometimes can be <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=351177"" rel=""noreferrer"">rather buggy</a>.</p>

<p>One particular pain point is the way WinForms designer interacts with source control. There are two similar problems here. First of all, designer serializes edited form as code, and sometimes very minor changes in layout can make the designer generate completely different code (this is particularly noticeable if you edit toolbars) because it shuffles the code lines around - i.e. in reality it changed a single property value on one line, but it also reordered everything. This leads to very much noise in history (it's nigh impossible to tell what exactly was changed when looking at diffs), but more importantly, it means that merging such files is a major headache. This usually happens when two people work with the same form at the same time, and then one commits his changes, and the other one tries to commit, finds out that the file was changed in the meantime, tries to merge, sees the diffs, and jumps out of the nearest window.</p>

<p>A very similar problem happens when you use WinForms localizable forms, which pushes some properties to a resource file. Again, the designer very much likes to reorder property values in resource file for any trivial change, with all the same problems as described earlier.</p>

<p>Now as to deficiencies in WPF. A major one is that it's quite a bit more complicated, and may feel unfamiliar to someone with experience only with WinForms, VCL, VB, or other similar ""traditional"" frameworks. Another problem is that documentation, in my opinion, is not perfect - it usually gives a decent overview, but rarely covers corner cases, some of which can be pretty important. This is the case for WinForms, too, but there are fewer possible combinations there, so fewer corner cases as well. </p>

<p>There's also the issue of third-party components. WinForms had been around for a long time now, and there are plenty of those available for it, and a lot of them are very mature. WPF is comparatively young and still going through growth pains, and so do most third-party solutions for it.</p>

<p>One particular pet peeve of mine in WPF is the way it antialiases text - which is perceived as being of much worse quality compared to plain Windows ClearType by most people, especially on small font sizes; see <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=380919"" rel=""noreferrer"">this bug report</a> for more info. This is fixed in WPF 4, but that isn't released yet, and even when it will be, chances are that you'll want to stick with the tried and true 3.5 SP1 for some time; and the fix isn't backported.</p>

"38861365","2016-08-09 22:21:38","8","","","","<p>Typical techniques involve mocking the standard <code>sys.stdin</code> and <code>sys.stdout</code> with your desired items.  If you do not care for Python 3 compatibility you can just use the <code>StringIO</code> module, however if you want forward thinking and is willing to restrict to Python 2.7 and 3.3+, supporting for this both Python 2 and 3 in this way becomes possible without too much work through the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/library/io.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>io</code></a> module (but requires a bit of modification, but put this thought on hold for now).</p>

<p>Assuming you already have a <code>unittest.TestCase</code> going, you can create a utility function (or method in the same class) that will replace <code>sys.stdin</code>/<code>sys.stdout</code> as outlined.  First the imports:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import io
import unittest
</code></pre>

<p>In one of my recent projects I've done this for stdin, where it take a <code>str</code> for the inputs that the user (or another program through pipes) will enter into yours as stdin:</p>

<pre><code>def stub_stdin(testcase_inst, inputs):
    stdin = sys.stdin

    def cleanup():
        sys.stdin = stdin

    testcase_inst.addCleanup(cleanup)
    sys.stdin = StringIO(inputs)
</code></pre>

<p>As for stdout and stderr:</p>

<pre><code>def stub_stdouts(testcase_inst):
    stderr = sys.stderr
    stdout = sys.stdout

    def cleanup():
        sys.stderr = stderr
        sys.stdout = stdout

    testcase_inst.addCleanup(cleanup)
    sys.stderr = StringIO()
    sys.stdout = StringIO()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in both cases, it accepts a testcase instance, and calls its <a href=""https://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>addCleanup</code></a> method that adds the <code>cleanup</code> function call that will reset them back to where they were when the duration of a test method is concluded.  The effect is that for the duration from when this was invoked in the test case until the end, <code>sys.stdout</code> and friends will be replaced with the <code>io.StringIO</code> version, meaning you can check its value easily, and don't have to worry about leaving a mess behind.</p>

<p>Better to show this as an example. To use this, you can simply create a test case like so:</p>

<pre><code>class ExampleTestCase(unittest.TestCase): 

    def test_example(self):
        stub_stdin(self, '42')
        stub_stdouts(self)
        example()
        self.assertEqual(sys.stdout.getvalue(), '42\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in Python 2, this test will only pass if the <code>StringIO</code> class is from the <code>StringIO</code> module, and in Python 3 no such module exists.  What you can do is use the version from the <code>io</code> module with a modification that makes it slightly more lenient in terms of what input it accepts, so that the unicode encoding/decoding will be done automatically rather than triggering an exception (such as <code>print</code> statements in Python 2 will not work nicely without the following).  I typically do this for cross compatibility between Python 2 and 3:</p>

<pre><code>class StringIO(io.StringIO):
    """"""
    A ""safely"" wrapped version
    """"""

    def __init__(self, value=''):
        value = value.encode('utf8', 'backslashreplace').decode('utf8')
        io.StringIO.__init__(self, value)

    def write(self, msg):
        io.StringIO.write(self, msg.encode(
            'utf8', 'backslashreplace').decode('utf8'))
</code></pre>

<p>Now plug your example function plus every code fragment in this answer into one file, you will get your self contained unittest that works in both Python 2 and 3 (although you need to call <code>print</code> as a function in Python 3) for doing testing against stdio.</p>

<p>One more note: you can always put the <code>stub_</code> function calls in the <code>setUp</code> method of the <code>TestCase</code> if every single test method requires that.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to use various mocks related libraries out there to stub out stdin/stdout, you are free to do so, but this way relies on no external dependencies if this is your goal.</p>

<hr>

<p>For your second issue, test cases have to be written in a certain way, where they must be encapsulated within a method and not at the class level, your original example will fail.  However you might want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Test(unittest.TestCase):

    def helper(self, data, answer, runner):
        stub_stdin(self, data)
        stub_stdouts(self)
        runner()
        self.assertEqual(sys.stdout.getvalue(), answer)
        self.doCleanups()  # optional, see comments below

    def test_various_inputs(self):
        data_and_answers = [
            ('hello', 'HELLOhello'),
            ('goodbye', 'GOODBYEgoodbye'),
        ]

        runScript = upperlower  # the function I want to test 

        for data, answer in data_and_answers:
            self.helper(data, answer, runScript)
</code></pre>

<p>The reason why you might want to call <code>doCleanups</code> is to prevent the cleanup stack from getting as deep as all the <code>data_and_answers</code> pairs are there, but that will pop everything off the cleanup stack so if you had any other things that need to be cleaned up at the end this might end up being problematic - you are free to leave that there as all of the stdio related objects will be restored at the end in the same order, so the real one will always be there.  Now the function I wanted to test:</p>

<pre><code>def upperlower():
    raw = raw_input()
    print (raw.upper() + raw),
</code></pre>

<p>So yes, a bit of explanation for what I did might help: remember within a <code>TestCase</code> class, the framework relies strictly on the instance's <code>assertEqual</code> and friends for it to function.  So to ensure testing being done at the right level you really want to call those asserts all the time so that helpful error messages will be shown at the moment the error occurred with the inputs/answers that didn't quite show up right, rather than until the very end like what you did with the for loop (that will tell you something was wrong, but not exactly where out of the hundreds and now you are mad).  Also the <code>helper</code> method - you can call it anything you want, as long as it doesn't start with <code>test</code> because then the framework will try to run it as one and it will fail terribly.  So just follow this convention and you can basically have templates within your test case to run your test with - you can then use it in a loop with a bunch of inputs/outputs like what I did.</p>

<p>As for your other question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>only I've had a little problem importing StringIO, because I was doing import StringIO and I needed to import like from StringIO import StringIO (I don't understand really why), but be that as It may, it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if you look at my original code I did show you how did <code>import io</code> and then overrode the <code>io.StringIO</code> class by defining <code>class StringIO(io.StringIO)</code>.  However it works for you because you are doing this strictly from Python 2, whereas I do try to target my answers to Python 3 whenever possible given that Python 2 will (probably definitely this time) not be supported in less than 5 years.  Think of the future users that might be reading this post who had similar problem as you.  Anyway, yes, the original <code>from StringIO import StringIO</code> works, as that's the <code>StringIO</code> class from the <code>StringIO</code> module.  Though <code>from cStringIO import StringIO</code> should work as that imports the <code>C</code> version of the <code>StringIO</code> module. It works because they all offer close enough interfaces, and so they will basically work as intended (until of course you try to run this under Python 3).</p>

<p>Again, putting all this together along with my code should result in a <a href=""https://gist.github.com/metatoaster/64139971b53ad728dba636e34b8a5558"" rel=""noreferrer"">self-contained working test script</a>.  Do remember to look at documentation and follow the form of the code, and not invent your own syntax and hoping things to work (and as for exactly why your code didn't work, because the ""test"" code was defined at where the class was being constructed, so all of that was executed while Python was importing your module, and since none of the things that are needed for the test to run are even available (namely the class itself doesn't even exist yet), the whole thing just dies in fits of twitching agony). Asking questions here help too, even though the issue you face is something really common, not having a quick and simple name to search for your exact problem does make it difficult to figure out where you went wrong, I supposed? :)  Anyway good luck, and good on you for taking the effort to test your code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Will <code>dbWriteTable()</code> work properly if <code>supports.transactions: TRUE</code>? If so, how do I change it to <code>TRUE</code>? Or maybe something else is the problem. Neither the DBI or ODBC package manuals mention <code>supports.transactions</code>, so I suspect my problem is rather basic. Thanks in advance.</p>

  <p>""...you would indeed need to drop x86 in order to be compliant with

<p>I've personally dropped the support today for x86 in Google Play Store for an Android App built with Unity.
I've just got a warning that I will lose support from <strong>2 devices from a total a 10867 previously supported</strong>.</p>

<li>Unity is dropping support on Android x86 and x86_64 (1)</li>

This is documented in <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PEP 591 – <em>Adding a final qualifier to typing</em></a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that the <code>typing</code> module gains two new objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html#typing.Final"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>typing.Final</code> typing construct</a></li>
<li>The <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html#typing.final"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>@typing.final()</code> decorator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be up-front: <em>The Python language itself does not gain <code>final</code> syntax or support</em>. The above objects do not alter how Python works, they are constructs that <em>merely document</em> that an object or reference is to be considered final. The new objects can trivially be backported to older Python releases. The <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>typing-extensions</code> project</a>, which provides backports of <code>typing</code> features from later to earlier Python versions, <a href=""https://github.com/python/typing/commit/c6c7dfdd4b999a2bbd46d120adeacc504d74e044"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has already included these objects</a>.</p>
<p>Their use lies in using a type hint <em>checker</em> like <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html#typing.final"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mypy</a> to check that your project correctly treats the objects so documented as final.</p>
<p>Their use is otherwise exactly like that of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_(Java)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>final</code> keyword in Java</a>: to state that a specific reference can only be assigned to <em>once</em>, that a method cannot be overridden in a subclass, or that a class definition cannot be subclassed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the <code>typing.Final</code> object to mark a global or attribute as final, documenting that the value will never change once assigned to:</p>
<pre><code>  GLOBAL_CONSTANT: Final[str] = &quot;This is a constant value because it is final&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>@typing.final</code> decorator to mark a method as non-overridable (subclasses can't define a different implementation) or a class as non-inheritable (you can't create subclasses from the class):</p>
<pre><code>  @final
  class FinalClass:
      &quot;&quot;&quot;This class can't be inherited from&quot;&quot;&quot;

  class SomeClass:
      @final
      def final_method(self):
          &quot;&quot;&quot;Subclasses can't define a different final_method implementation&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see the <a href=""https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/final_attrs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mypy documentation on their use</a>, which covers such details as to what ways of assigning the value of a <code>Final</code> attribute are acceptable.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat demo.py
from typing import final, Final

# FOO is marked final, can't assign another value to it
FOO: Final[int] = 42

class Foo:
    @final

"20139774","2013-11-22 07:55:15","5","","","","<p>While I am familiar with Vaadin 6 &amp; 7, I'm not an expert on WebSocket. So take what I have to say with a grain of salt. But here goes…</p>
<p>(a) Your drawing suggests that you have a focus on the client (browser) side. You might need to shift your thinking. The main point of Vaadin is that the app actually runs on the server. While we conceptually think of our app as running in front of the user, we know the app’s state and execution actually live on the server. We do not usually think in terms of what is literally going on inside the web browser.</p>
<p>This is what makes Vaadin so special, and not one of the many <em>yet-another-web-framework</em> projects. As far as I know, Vaadin is nearly unique in this regard. The only other web app kit with a server-side-execution architecture like Vaadin is the (non-Java) <a href=""http://www.xojo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Xojo</a>, Web Edition (formerly known as Real Studio).</p>
<p>(b) Seems like what you really want is called &quot;push&quot;, without concerning yourself with WebSocket details. To explain…</p>
<h2>React To User</h2>
<p>Normally a Vaadin app waits to respond to a user's action, such as typing in a field or clicking a button.</p>
<p>When the user clicks a button in the browser, for example, the Vaadin framework installed browser-side automatically notifies the Vaadin app running on the server of that user's action. The server-side app then runs some code attached to the button. That pure-Java code is running on the server. Say the button updates the text in a field. When your server-side code updates the text value, the Vaadin server-side framework automatically notifies the browser-side Vaadin framework of the new value. The new value automatically appears on screen for the user to see.</p>
<p>Note that we as Vaadin programmers do not concern ourselves with the nitty-gritty details of the back-and-forth that just happened in the scenario above. The browser-server interaction may have been performed with HTTP request-responses, with long-polling, or with WebSocket, or with who knows what all. We don’t care. That Vaadin 7.1 happens to be using the <a href=""https://github.com/Atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Atmosphere framework</a> as part of its implementation is not (usually) any of our concern. That's the power, and special distinction, of Vaadin.</p>
<h2>Push</h2>
<p>Sometimes a programmer would like to update the display seen by the user without waiting for the user to take an action.</p>
<p>Perhaps the data being displayed in a report to the user is changing. The programmer might want her app to be so slick as to automatically update the report without the user having to bother clicking an <em>Update</em> button. This behavior is called &quot;push&quot;, as in <em>pushing</em> updates to the user's screen. The Vaadin blog posting, <a href=""https://vaadin.com/blog/-/blogs/roadmap-for-the-next-74-days"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roadmap for the next 74 days</a>, explains that a major innovation of Vaadin 7.1 is support for push.</p>
<p>In Vaadin 6, some folks used add-ons (plugins) to gain some push features. But given that Vaadin 6 was not architected with that in mind, there were limitations.</p>
<h2>Focus on Push</h2>
<p>So, WebSockets is one way of getting push, but not the only way. Focus your attention on the &quot;push&quot; features. Let Vaadin do the worrying about whether it should use WebSockets with Atmosphere or some other technology du jour.</p>
<p>Read the <a href=""https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/advanced.push.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Server Push</a> chapter in <a href=""https://www.vaadin.com/book"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Book of Vaadin</a>. That may be all you need to get started.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a Vaadin programmer, you should not have to care about WebSocket. But as a system administrator, you should be very excited about WebSocket. This technology promises an enormous increase in the speed, responsiveness, and robustness of the app. Caveat: This technology is new, so we do not yet know how it performs in the real world. Given the promise, and the availability of Vaadin 7.1, you may want to enable your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Servlet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Servlet</a> container with WebSocket support.</p>
<p><a href=""http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSR-356 Java WebSocket</a> this year (2013) defined a standard interface for the WebSocket protocol defined by <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IETF rfc 6455</a>.</p>
<p>Apache <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tomcat 8</a> innovated an implementation of that JSR. That implementation has been backported to <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tomcat 7.0.47</a>, deprecating the Apache Tomcat proprietary WebSocket API in favor of the new JSR-356 implementation. Tomcat 8 is at release-candidate stage, so you may want to try it, though I don't know what may work best with Vaadin 7.1.</p>
<p>Eclipse <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jetty</a> also <a href=""http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Feature/WebSockets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supports WebSocket</a>. Jetty compares closely to Tomcat, both work very well in general (though I cannot speak to their WebSocket features).</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Servlet_containers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Other Servlet containers</a> may offer support for WebSocket.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Pay attention to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/20149068/642706"">the answer</a> by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2044473/jfarcand"">jfarcand</a>. I just noticed that he (Jean‑François Arcand) is the creator of <a href=""http://async-io.org/release.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Atmosphere framework</a>!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-10:</strong> The Servlet containers such as <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache Tomcat</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eclipse Jetty</a> have been iterating many releases for fixes and improvements for WebSocket.

  <p>Is it an error in tools or the XML is really not well-formed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar"" rel=""nofollow"">well formed</a> in the latest specification, which is XML 1.0 Fifth Edition. But it was <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/#NT-Letter"" rel=""nofollow"">not well-formed</a> in the previous edition, which was current until 2008.</p>

<p>The original XML 1.0 spec (from 1998) locked down the set of name characters to the characters that were defined as letters in the Unicode standard of the time. That didn't include <code>𐐀</code> which only came in with Unicode 3.1 a few years later.</p>

<p>XML 1.1 was much looser about what characters it would accept in names (largely for this reason, to allow characters from future Unicode versions), and this is a Good Thing. However XML 1.1 has never really caught on, so the Editors decided to backport the newer, more permissive namechar rules from there to 1.0. This was <a href=""http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/12/why-i-think-xml-10-fifth-editi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">controversial</a> and all in all probably not a Good Thing.</p>

<p>This means you can use <code>𐐀</code> in names in XML 1.0 documents and be usable by a subset of parsers that have updated for Fifth Edition (or never implemented the strict rules in the first place), or you can use them in XML 1.1 documents and be usable by a different set of parsers that support XML 1.1.</p>

<p>Or, more realistically, you can avoid those characters which are sort-of-well-formed-depending altogether, and feel a little sad.</p>

"2020717","2010-01-07 13:48:53","18","","","","<p>If you enabled the watchdog driver in your kernel, the watchdog driver sets up a kernel timer, in charge of resetting the watchdog.

<p>If no application opens the <code>/dev/watchdog</code> file, then the kernel takes care of resetting the watchdog. Since it is a timer, it won't appear as a dedicated kernel thread, but handled by the soft IRQ thread. Now, if an application opens this file, it becomes responsible of the watchdog, and can reset it by writing to the file, as documented by the documentation linked in Richard's post.</p>
<p>Is the watchdog driver configured in your kernel?
If not, you should configure it, and see if the reset still happens. If it still happens, it is likely that your reset comes from somewhere else.</p>
<p>If your kernel is too old to have a proper watchdog driver (not present in 2.6.25) you should backport it from 2.6.28. Or you can try to disable the watchdog in your bootloader and see if the reset still occurs.</p>

"2029064","2010-01-08 16:37:18","3","","","","<p>I don't have hard data for Objective C, but I do have a good place to look for C++.  </p>

<p>C++ started as C with Classes according to Bjarne Stroustroup in his reflection on the early years of C++ (<a href=""http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/hopl2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/hopl2.pdf</a>), so C++ can be thought of (like Objective C) as pushing C to its limits for object orientation.  </p>

<p>What are those limits?  In the 1994-1997 time frame, a lot of researchers figured out that object-orientation came at a cost due to dynamic binding, e.g. when C++ functions are marked virtual and there may/may not be children classes that override these functions.  (In Java and C#, all functions expect ctors are inherently virtual, and there isnt' much you can do about it.) In ""A Study of Devirtualization Techniques for a Java Just-In-Time Compiler"" from researchers at IBM Research Tokyo, they contrast the techniques used to deal with this, including one from Urz Hölzle and Gerald Aigner.  Urz Hölzle, in a separate paper with Karel Driesen, had shown that on average 5.7% of time in C++ programs (and up to ~50%) was spent in calling virtual functions (e.g. vtables + thunks).  He later worked with some Smalltalk researachers in what ended up the Java HotSpot VM to solve these problems in OO.  Some of these features are being backported to C++ (e.g. 'protected' and Exception handling).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, C++ is static typed where Objective C is duck typed.  The performance difference in execution (but not lines of code) probably is a result of this difference.</p>

"20291416","2013-11-29 18:13:39","101","","","","<p>Unfortunately, this is not a trivial task.</p>

<p><code>DatePickers</code> use widgets <code>NumberPicker</code> and <code>CalendarView</code> internally. For instance, the image you have posted is using 3 <code>NumberPickers</code>. And the dividers you are talking about come from NumberPicker's attribute: <code>selectionDivider</code>. The problem is that this attribute is not public, and neither is <code>numberPickerStyle</code>, through which, this attribute is set. </p>

<p>I recently back-ported CalendarView and NumberPicker to API 8, mostly for fun. Since the code is readily available(look up <code>android.widget.NumberPicker</code> and others in android's source), all this task takes is time, and some digging through android's source-code. Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Easy ==> You'll have to change the private variable from View class to their accessor methods</p>

<p>mLeft (protected variable in View class) ==> getLeft() (public accessor method)</p></li>
<li><p>The most time-consuming task was restoring the Accessibility methods.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, if you do decide on writing custom implementation of DatePicker, you'll have to write them for NumberPicker and CalendarView (optionally) as well.</p>

<p><strong>Easier way:</strong></p>

<p>Backported DatePicker is available as a library here: <a href=""https://github.com/SimonVT/android-datepicker"" rel=""noreferrer"">Android-DatePicker</a>. As mentioned above, you'll be using backported <a href=""https://github.com/SimonVT/android-calendarview"" rel=""noreferrer"">CalendarView</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/SimonVT/android-numberpicker"" rel=""noreferrer"">NumberPicker</a> in conjunction with this DatePicker.</p>

<p><strong>What you need to change:</strong></p>

<p>Use <code>{library-numberpicker} / res / drawable-xxxx / np_numberpicker_selection_divider.9.png</code> as a template, and change the 'bluish' color to green (I used <a href=""http://pixlr.com/editor"" rel=""noreferrer"">pixlr</a>). You can either save it with the same name, if you want to be done with the blue divider altogether, or use a different name and make changes in <code>{library-numberpicker} / res / values / themes.xml</code>. </p>

<p>The changes required in <code>themes.xml</code> if you choose a different name:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name=""NPWidget.Holo.NumberPicker"" parent=""NPWidget.NumberPicker""&gt;
    ....
    &lt;item name=""selectionDivider""&gt;@drawable/new_nine_path_drawable_name&lt;/item&gt;
    ....
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it.</p>

<p>Output using the libraries:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dUtr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the <code>android:divider</code> refer to the divider in the datepicker, and
  how could I use it to change color?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attribute <code>divider</code> actually comes from <code>LinearLayout</code>. <code>NumberPicker</code> inherits this attribute as <code>NumberPicker extends LinearLayout</code>. But this <code>divider</code> serves a different purpose. The drawable passed to this attribute is placed between child views of <code>LinearLayout</code>. </p>

<p>The attribute <code>android:showDividers</code> is used to change the placement of this divider, possible values being:</p>

<ul>
<li>none: No dividers shown</li>
<li>beginning: Divider is shown before the first child view</li>
<li>middle: Divider is shown after each child view, not not after the last child view</li>
<li>end: Divider is shown after the last child view</li>
</ul>

<p>The attribute <code>android:dividerPadding</code> is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Even though NumberPicker inherits this attribute, it does not use it. This is evident from your own research &amp; trials: <code>I tried a multitude of combinations of the two, but I don't seem to get it to work.</code></p>

<p>To see the divider attribute in action:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:orientation=""horizontal""
    android:divider=""@android:drawable/ic_media_play""
    android:showDividers=""middle"" &gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:text=""Hello"" /&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:text=""World,"" /&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:text=""Again"" /&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Hack-ish workaround using java reflection:</strong></p>

<p>This answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/20396673/2558882"">here</a> gave me the idea. I hate using refection in general, mostly for reasons listed in this answer: <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/101217"">Link</a>.

<p>What we do here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend DatePicker</li>
<li>If you open <code>date_picker.xml</code> in <code>sdk/platforms/android-xx/res/layout</code>, you'll see that the three NumberPickers have ids <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>year</code>. We access <code>android.internal.R.id</code> to get resource ids for these NumberPickers.</li>
<li>We create three NumberPicker objects using these ids with <code>findViewById(int)</code> method.</li>
<li>Then, access and retrieve the Field <code>mSelectionDivider</code> using relection.</li>
<li>Set the field to accessible (as its declared final), set its value using <code>Field#set(Object, Object)</code> method. The first argument is the Object that we perform this operation on. Second argument is the Object that we want to set.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>from __future__ import unicode_literals
from builtins import str
</code></pre>

<p>In the default iPython 2.7 kernel : </p>

<p>(iPython session)</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: type(""é"") # By default, quotes in py2 create py2 strings, which is the same thing as a sequence of bytes that given some encoding, can be decoded to a character in that encoding.
Out[1]: str

In [2]: type(""é"".decode(""utf-8"")) # We can get to the actual text data by decoding it if we know what encoding it was initially encoded in, utf-8 is a safe guess in almost every country but Myanmar.
Out[2]: unicode

In [3]: len(""é"") # Note that the py2 `str` representation has a length of 2.  There's one byte for the ""e"" and one byte for the accent.  
Out[3]: 2

In [4]: len(""é"".decode(""utf-8"")) # the py2 `unicode` representation has length 1, since an accented e is a single character
Out[4]: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Some other things of note in python 2.7:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>""é""</code> is the same thing as <code>str(""é"")</code></li>
<li><code>u""é""</code> is the same thing as <code>""é"".decode('utf-8')</code> or <code>unicode(""é"", 'utf-8')</code></li>
<li><code>u""é"".encode('utf-8')</code> is the same thing as <code>str(""é"")</code></li>
<li>You typically call decode with a py2 <code>str</code>, and encode with py2 <code>unicode</code>.  

<ul>
<li>Due to early design issues, you can call both on either even though that doesn't really make any sense.</li>
<li>In python3, <code>str</code>, which is the same as python2 <code>unicode</code>, can no longer be decoded since a string by definition is a decoded sequence of bytes.  By default, it uses the utf-8 encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Byte sequences that were encoded with in the ascii codec behave exactly the same as their decoded counterparts.

<ul>
<li>In python 2.7 with no future imports : <code>type(""a"".decode('ascii'))</code> gives a unicode object, but this behaves nearly identically with <code>str(""a"")</code>.  This is not the case in python3.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, here's what the snippets above do : </p>

<ul>
<li><code>__future__</code> is a module maintained by the core python team that backports python3 functionality to python2 to allow you to use python3 idioms within python2.</li>
<li><code>from __future__ import unicode_literals</code> has the following effect : 

<ul>
<li>Without the future import <code>""é""</code> is the same thing as <code>str(""é"")</code></li>
<li>With the future import <code>""é""</code> is functionally the same thing as <code>unicode(""é"")</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>builtins</code> is a module that is approved by the core python team, and contains safe aliases for using python3 idioms in python2 with the python3 api. 

<ul>
<li>Due to reasons beyond me, the package itself is named ""future"", so to install the <code>builtins</code> module you run : <code>pip install future</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>from builtins import str</code> has the following effect  :

<ul>
<li>the <code>str</code> constructor now gives what you think it does, i.e. text data in the form of python2 unicode objects. So it's functionally the same thing as  <code>str = unicode</code> </li>
<li>Note : Python3 <code>str</code> is functionally the same as Python2 <code>unicode</code></li>
<li>Note : To get bytes, you can use the ""bytes"" prefix, e.g. <code>b'é'</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The takeaway is this : </p>

<ol>
<li>Decode on read/Decode early on and encode on write/encode at the end</li>
<li>Use <code>str</code> objects for bytes and <code>unicode</code> objects for text</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Let me update the question:</p>

<p>After installing the dependencies</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/local/jumpgate &amp;&amp; sudo pip install -r tools/requirements.txt

<p>I had to rollback oslo.config and falcon to previous version</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install -U oslo.config==1.5.0
sudo pip install -U falcon==0.1.8
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm able to install Jumpgate and run it.</p>

<pre><code>gunicorn ""jumpgate.wsgi:make_api()"" --bind=""localhost:5000"" --timeout=600 --access-logfile=""-"" -w 4

<p>But Collections.sort() has no idea that it would need to <strong>lock</strong> the whole list while doing its work. You give it a list, and if another thread is trying to modify the list at the same time ... good luck with that. </p>

<p>Or if you reverse the point of view: how should a ""thread-safe"" list understand that it is right now in the process of being sorted; so - some accesses (like swapping elements) are fine; but others (like adding/removing) elements are not?!</p>

<p>In other words: I think you can only do this: pick any of the ""thread-safe"" list implementations; and then you have to put <strong>your own wrapper</strong> in place that </p>

<ol>
<li>""Locks"" the list for changes</li>
<li>Does the sorting work</li>
<li>""Unlocks"" the list</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, for ""2.""; you are free to turn to Collections.sort().</p>

<p>Or, if you are using Java8 - you use the CopyOnWriteArrayList and its already implemented sort() method (which is kind of proving my point: you can only do <em>proper sorting</em> if you <strong>own</strong> the list while running the sort operation!).</p>

<p>Giving your latest comment: of course, you could manually ""backport"" the Java8 version of CopyOnWriteArrayList into your environment and use that; but of course, that won't help; as I understand that Java6-Collections.sort() will <strong>not</strong> call the new sort() method from that class. </p>

<p>So, it seems that the sum of your requirements can't be resolved; and you will have to bite the bullet and doing most of that in your own code.</p>

<p><code>/var/log/apache2/error.log</code> reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ImportError: No module named
  django.core.handlers.wsgi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Googling this brings up a couple results, mostly dealing with permissions errors because <code>www-data</code> can't read certain files and/or the pythonpath is not correct. Some of the solutions are vague or just don't work in my circumstance.</p>

<p>Background information..</p>

<p>My /usr/lib directory..</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib/python2.4
/usr/lib/python2.5
/usr/lib/python2.6
/usr/lib/python-django
</code></pre>

<p>The default python version is 2.5.2. If I open the interpreter as a regular user I can <code>import django.core.handlers.wsgi</code> with no issues.</p>

<p>If I switch to <code>www-data</code> the python version is the same, and I can import the <code>django.core.handlers.wsgi</code> module no problem.</p>

<p>In my bashrc, I set my PYTHONPATH to my home directory which contains all my django sites...</p>

<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=/home/meder/django-sites/:$PYTHONPATH
</code></pre>

<p>So the directory structure is:</p>

<pre><code>django-sites/
   test
</code></pre>

<p><code>test</code> is the directory created by <code>django-admin createproject</code>.</p>

<p>My virtualhost:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName beta.blah.com
    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/meder/django-sites/test/apache/django.wsgi
    Alias /media /home/meder/django-sites/test/media/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/home/meder/django-sites/test/apache/django.wsgi</code> file itself:</p>

<pre><code>import os, sys

sys.path.append('/usr/local/django')
sys.path.append('/home/meder/django-sites')
sys.path.append('/home/meder/django-sites/test')
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'test.settings'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi

application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, my OS is Debian Lenny and I grabbed django 1.1.1 from backports. Hope that's enough information.</p>

<p><strong>Update #1</strong> - per the first reply here's the result of <code>ldd /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so</code>:</p>

<pre><code>meder@site:/usr/lib/apache2/modules$ ldd mod_wsgi.so
    libpython2.5.so.1.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libpython2.5.so.1.0 (0xb7d99000)

    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7efd000)

<p>Here are a couple of suggestions for making this easier:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to batch your GUI operations.  In addition to requiring less code (via less invoke calls), you'll get better performance.  Each Dispatcher.Invoke call carries a fair amount of overhead, since it posts a message into the Dispatcher's message queue which must be processed.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using Dispatcher.BeginInvoke to avoid blocking, unless you really need to wait.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can use the Task Parallel Library from .NET 4 (or the backport to 3.5sp1 in the Rx Framework), you might want to consider reworking this to use <a href=""http://reedcopsey.com/2009/11/17/synchronizing-net-4-tasks-with-the-ui-thread/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Task instances synchronized to the GUI thread</a>.  By creating a TaskScheduler using FromCurrentSynchronizationContext, you can schedule tasks to run on the GUI easier than the Dispatcher Invoke calls.  This also can give you some control over batching, since you can schedule them, and block/wait as needed, very easily.</p></li>

Although I just upgraded my Pytorch to the latest CUDA version from pytorch.org (<code>1.2.0</code>), it still throws the same error. I'm on Windows 10 and use conda with python 3.7.</p>

<p>One option is to backport <code>tools.logging</code> to Clojure 1.1 if you are stuck with 1.1 for some unfortunate reason. Otherwise, you should upgrade to Clojure 1.5.1 and then you can use the current libraries &amp; post-contrib ecosystem.</p>

Another thing confused me is that the output log printed when run in build is different from the log printed when run in a container(i.e. run in ""docker container run -it image_name /bin/bash""). 
Please help me.</p>

<p>I have tried some keywords like ""apt-get install stuck"", but i didn't find a similar question.</p>

<p>Your confusion is due to the fact that the class method <code>Module.constants</code> hides the instance method <code>Module#constants</code> for <code>Module</code>.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, this has been addressed by adding an optional parameter:</p>

<pre><code># No argument: same class method as in 1.8:
Module.constants         # ==&gt; All constants
# One argument: uses the instance method:
Module.constants(true)   # ==&gt; Constants of Module (and included modules)
Module.constants(false)  # ==&gt; Constants of Module (only).
</code></pre>

<p>In your example above, <code>A.constants</code> calls <code>Module#constants</code> (the instance method), while <code>Module.constants</code> calls, well, <code>Module.constants</code>.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, you thus want to call <code>Module.constants(true)</code>.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.8, it is possible to call the instance method <code>#constants</code> on <code>Module</code>. You need to get the instance method and bind it as a class method (using a different name):</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; Module
  define_method :constants_of_module, Module.instance_method(:constants)
end

# Now use this new class method:
class Module
   COOL = 42
end
Module.constants.include?(""COOL"")  # ==&gt; false, as you mention
Module.constants_of_module         # ==&gt; [""COOL""], the result you want
</code></pre>

<p>I wish I was able to backport the 1.9 functionality completely to 1.8 for my <code>backports</code> gem, but I can't think of a way to get only the constants of a Module, excluding the inherited ones, in Ruby 1.8.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: Just changed the official documentation to correctly reflect this...</p>

"2322329","2010-02-23 22:44:32","4","","","","<p>For now, Python 3 is not widely deployed in production. Depends on what you use Python for. If it's just for one off scripts, it will be ok either way, if the idea is to use third party modules, C modules and or deploy painlessly, then settle for any of the 2.4+ versions. Many projects strive to keep 2.3 compativility, but you shouldn't have any problems to use 2.4-2.6, as the changes in the language are minor. If you can, use 2.6, as it's the closest to Python 3, as it has some features backported to it.</p>

<p>The problem with Python 3 is a Catch 22:</p>

<ul>
<li>most useful third party modules are still not ported to 3, as developers are waiting for wide usage,</li>
<li>people can't migrate because modules they rely on haven't migrated yet, keeping the sage low.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not have any problems using any of the 2.4-2.6, give 3, some time.</p>

Of course features that rely on lexer/parser support (such as variadic templates) can not be emulated, but for the most part it allows me to write forwards-compatible code in MSVC 2008 Express (my main Windows target). </p>

<p>However the idea would be that you use another compiler. There's GCC support for about as hight as 4.6 for Windows XP (via eg.: Mingw installer), and it brings about most of the important C++11 niceties such as variadic templates and <code>constexpr</code>, <code>noexcept</code>.</p>

Again, a more complete solution would then try and parse the text (which must be done separately for each provider, as there is no standard format) and return a more structured format (e.g., set a flag <code>available</code> which specifies whether or not the domain looks available). have fun!</p>

<p>If I change <code>&lt;packaging&gt;</code> to <code>jar</code> from <code>wcc</code> then my tests run and pass just fine.</p>

<p>So why am I getting this error, and more importantly how do I fix it?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Further Investigation</strong></p>

<p>Maven surefire plugin only supports <code>java.lang.String</code> properties.
My plugin has a pair of <code>java.io.File</code> properties.</p>

<pre><code>@Parameter(property = ""componentZip"", defaultValue = ""${componentLocation}"")
protected File componentZip;

@Parameter(property = ""manifestFile"", defaultValue = ""${project.basedir}/manifest.hda"")
protected File manifestFile;
</code></pre>

<p>These properties are used by my plugin for packing the zip file, 
along with packaging the file appropriately and making sure it is built in the expected format.</p>

<p>How can I get surefire to ignore these config properties? Do I need to make them  <code>String</code> and add conversions to <code>File</code> in my plugin where It's used that way?</p>

The problem I am facing is, after the logstash container is created, the logs show the pipeline configuration was correctly picked and the data flows through to the elasticsearch container. Then once all the data has been moved, the logstash container destroys itself and a new container is created which follows the same steps as the last one.</p>

"39240279","2016-08-31 03:30:32","10","","","","<p>The <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#creating-a-namespace-package"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python documentation</a> has a good description of the three ways of creating namespace packages in Python, including guidelines for when to use each of the three methods. Furthermore, this topic is discussed in great depth in a different StackOverflow <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1675734/how-do-i-create-a-namespace-package-in-python"">thread</a> which has a good <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/27586272/2063031"">accepted answer</a>. Finally, if you are someone who would rather read code than documentation, the <a href=""https://github.com/pypa/sample-namespace-packages"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>sample-namespace-packages</code></a> repo contains examples of namespace packages created using each of the three available methods.</p>

<p>In brief, if you intend your packages to work with Python versions 3.3 and above, you should use the <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages"" rel=""noreferrer"">native namespace packages</a> method. If you intend your packages to work with older versions of Python, you should use the <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pkgutil</code> method</a>. If you intend to add a namespace package to a namespace that is already using the <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkg-resources-style-namespace-packages"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pkg_resources</code> method</a>, you should continue to use method.</p>

<hr>

<p>With <em>native namespace packages</em>, we can remove <code>__init__.py</code> from both packages and modify our <em>setup.py</em> files to look as follows:</p>

<pre><code># setup.py file for my_data.source_a
from setuptools import setup, find_namespace_packages

setup(
    name=""my_data.source_a"",
    version=""0.1"",
    packages=find_namespace_packages(include=['my_data.*'])
)
</code></pre>

<pre><code># setup.py file for my_data.source_b
from setuptools import setup, find_namespace_packages

setup(
    name=""my_data.source_b"",
    version=""0.1"",
    packages=find_namespace_packages(include=['my_data.*'])
)
</code></pre>

<p>We need to add the <code>include=['my_data.*']</code> argument because, by default <code>find_namespace_packages()</code> is rather lenient in the folders that it includes as namespace packages, as described <a href=""https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#find-namespace-packages"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach for packages supporting Python 3.3 and above.</p>

<hr>

<p>With <em><code>pkgutil</code>-style namespace packages</em>, we need to add the following line to the <code>my_data.__init__.py</code> files in <em>each of our packages</em>:</p>

<pre><code>__path__ = __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)
</code></pre>

<p>This is the approach used by the <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/backports/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>backports</code></a> namespace, and by different packages in the <a href=""https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>google-cloud-python</code></a> repo, and it is the recommended approach for supporting older versions of Python.</p>

"2420200","2010-03-10 20:09:19","0","","","","<p>I think you may be missing something, or asking for a logical impossiblity.  Functionally, there are two ways of doing the merges from ""unstable"" to ""testing"".  Either you can merge in <em>only</em> the code associated with a given ""done"" story, or you can merge <em>everything</em> from unstable to testing when a story is finished.</p>

<p>These have advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage of the first is that things only end up on the testing branch when they're complete, so you don't have parts of incomplete stories outside of unstable.  The disadvantage is that the parts that you merge may depend on parts that you didn't merge, so the merge isn't just a simple copy.  Alternately, the advantage of the second is that merging is trivial (just a copy, no thought required), but you end up with incomplete things in testing.</p>

<p>Functionally, in some ways the first option is like having different feature branches except they're all in the same tree.  You still have to have some way of tracking what code is part of what ""story"", and you have to disentangle the various pieces in order to merge some particular bits of it into testing, and you have the problems of interdependencies and so forth as a result of that disentangling.  As a result, this merging policy may not actually get you very many of the benefits of Continuous Integration -- but, in some situations, it may be a good tradeoff, and preserve some benefits of Continuous Building that are more valuable to your project.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it sounds like a fair part of the point of Continuous Integration is that things are continuously being integrated into the main trunk, rather than only being integrated when they're ""complete"".  Thus, if you're thoroughly buying into that philosophy, it seems to me that having incomplete things in your testing branch is the expected situation -- it's inherent in the philosophy of the system.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, though, that Debian et al are functionally following the first approach; things are only merged from one stage to the other in a piecemeal fashion when they're complete at some level.  To some extent, things can be simplified by only merging code-entangled ""stories"" together when all of them are complete, but there is a lot of work in ""backporting"" patches in order to merge things from one level to the other.  Although the idea of having a three-level unstable/testing/stable structure seems useful for Continuous Integration, I don't think much of Debian's policies beyond that will carry over if you're using the merge-everything philosophy.</p>

"20556554","2013-12-12 23:44:41","1","","","","<p>It's hard to parallelize code that needs to mutate the same shared data from different tasks. So, I'm going to assume that <code>setinner</code> and <code>setouter</code> are non-mutating functions; if that's not true, things will be more complicated.</p>

<p>The first step is to decide what you want to do in parallel.</p>

<hr>

<p>One obvious thing is to do the <code>setinner</code> and <code>setouter</code> at the same time. They're completely independent of each other, and always need to both get done. So, that's what I'll do. Instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>inneropt,partition,x = setinner(Q,G,n)
outeropt = setouter(Q,G,n)
</code></pre>

<p>… we want to submit the two functions as tasks to the pool, then wait for both to be done, then get the results of both.</p>

<p>The <code>concurrent.futures</code> module (which requires a third-party backport in Python 2.x) makes it easier to do things like ""wait for both to be done"" than the <code>multiprocessing</code> module (which is in the stdlib in 2.6+), but in this case, we don't need anything fancy; if one of them finishes early, we don't have anything to do until the other finishes anyway. So, let's stick with <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.multiprocessing.Pool.apply_async"" rel=""nofollow""><code>multiprocessing.apply_async</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>pool = multiprocessing.Pool(2) # we never have more than 2 tasks to run

    # parallelly start both tasks
    inner_result = pool.apply_async(setinner, (Q, G, n))
    outer_result = pool.apply_async(setouter, (Q, G, n))

    # sequentially wait for both tasks to finish and get their results
    inneropt,partition,x = inner_result.get()
    outeropt = outer_result.get()

    # the rest of your loop is unchanged
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to move the pool outside the function so it lives forever and can be used by other parts of your code. And if not, you almost certainly want to shut the pool down at the end of the function. (Later versions of <code>multiprocessing</code> let you just use the pool in a <code>with</code> statement, but I think that requires Python 3.2+, so you have to do it explicitly.)</p>

<hr>

<p>What if you want to do more work in parallel? Well, there's nothing else obvious to do here without restructuring the loop. You can't do <code>updateGraph</code> until you get the results back from <code>setinner</code> and <code>setouter</code>, and nothing else is slow here.</p>

<p>But if you could reorganize things so that each loop's <code>setinner</code> were independent of everything that came before (which may or may not be possible with your algorithm—without knowing what you're doing, I can't guess), you could push 2000 tasks onto the queue up front, then loop by just grabbing results as needed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>pool = multiprocessing.Pool() # let it default to the number of cores
inner_results = []
outer_results = []
for _ in range(1000):
    inner_results.append(pool.apply_async(setinner, (Q,G,n,i))
    outer_results.append(pool.apply_async(setouter, (Q,G,n,i))
while i &lt; 1000:
    inneropt,partition,x = inner_results.pop(0).get()
    outeropt = outer_results.pop(0).get()
    # result of your loop is the same as before
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you can make this fancier.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you rarely need more than a couple hundred iterations, so it's wasteful to always compute 1000 of them. You can just push the first N at startup, and push one more every time through the loop (or N more every N times) so you never do more than N wasted iterations—you can't get an <em>ideal</em> tradeoff between perfect parallelism and minimal waste, but you can usually tune it pretty nicely.</p>

<p>Also, if the tasks don't actually take that long, but you have a lot of them, you may want to batch them up. One really easy way to do this is to use one of the <code>map</code> variants instead of <code>apply_async</code>; this can make your fetching code a tiny bit more complicated, but it makes the queuing and batching code completely trivial (e.g., to <code>map</code> each <code>func</code> over a list of 100 parameters with a <code>chunksize</code> of 10 is just two simple lines of code).</p>

<p>Do I need to declare JNI_OnLoad in a specific file or declare sth in Android.MK tells system where to find the JNI_OnLoad method? Now I just put to one of the many .cpp files.</p>

<p>compiled .so lib is attached. I try to dump the so file, and I am sure the JNI_OnLoad method is exported.

<p>Actually, I am trying to port a library from android source (libcorejava.so). To avoid class path conflict, I already change the class path.</p>

<p>And here is the file that declares JNI_OnLoad:
<a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/master/luni/src/main/native/Register.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/master/luni/src/main/native/Register.cpp</a>
I already change the signature to the above one in order to match the standard signature</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I found that android source does not load it by System.loadLibrary! It says libcorejava is used to implement System.loadLibrary, so we cannot use System.loadLibrary to load it. But in my case, it should not be a problem as I only need part of the function (ICU related).</p>

<p><a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/master/vm/Init.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/master/vm/Init.cpp</a></p>

<pre><code> // Most JNI libraries can just use System.loadLibrary, but you can't
    // if you're the library that implements System.loadLibrary!
    loadJniLibrary(""javacore"");
    loadJniLibrary(""nativehelper"");
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 2:<br>
It turns out that it is because the name conflict of the library!
But it seems that libjavacore requires other library. Does there any tool that can list out what the dependency I am missing?</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load library: reloc_library[1286]: XXX
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 3:<br>
TextClock is a new api for displaying time. It only exists in 4.2+ api up. I am trying to backport it so that older sdk can uses it. It depends on a ICU library which resides in libjavacore. So I modify the Android.mk file to make sure the libjavacore only include the icu related source file and the final compiled so file is being included in my apk.</p>

<p>TextClock:<br>
<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextClock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextClock.html</a></p>

<p>It now works in the phone which originally support TextClock, but doesn't work in old devices. Here is the exception log. I think it is because libjavacore is the wrapper of ICU library. Apart from the wrapper, I still need to port the ICU library. But I am going to give up as the size of ICU library is quite large and seems doesn't worth for it...</p>

<p>Here, I'd mock out not only <code>utcnow()</code> but <code>strftime()</code> too, to just return a string object:</p>

<pre><code>with mock.patch('datetime.datetime') as dt_mock:
    dt_mock.utcnow.return_value.strftime.return_value = '2016-08-04 12:22:44.123456'
    result = DateTimeHelper.get_utc_millisecond_timestamp()
</code></pre>

<p>If you feel that testing the <code>strftime()</code> argument is important, give  <code>dt_mock.utcnow.return_value</code> an explicit <code>datetime</code> object to return instead; you'd have to create that test object <em>before</em> you mock however, as you can't mock out just the <code>datetime.datetime.utcnow</code> class method:</p>

<pre><code>testdt = datetime.datetime(2016, 8, 4, 12, 22, 44, 123456)
with mock.patch('datetime.datetime') as dt_mock:
    dt_mock.utcnow.return_value = testdt
    result = DateTimeHelper.get_utc_millisecond_timestamp()
</code></pre>

<p>or, in your unittests, use <code>from datetime import datetime</code> to keep a reference to the class that isn't mocked.</p>

<p>Demo:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from unittest import mock
&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; class DateTimeHelper(object):
...     @staticmethod

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>Here, git am does not succeed: some commit do not apply, either because they are already applied (there are two copies of the same patch in the patches produced by git format-patch) or because the patch is missing (result of a merge).  I would like to get the history in my copy to be able to bissect, and then remove the vfs_helper-induced changes, while keeping the later bug-fixing.</p>

<p>The C source code for <code>float.__str__()</code> formats a floating point value using the <code>g</code> formatter code to the <code>sprintf()</code> function, with a precision of 12 positions.</p>

<p>To get the same result in Python 2.6, you'll have to format the string yourself:</p>

<p>or use the <code>format()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>format(fp_value, '.12g')

<p>Note that in Python 2.7 only the <em>representation</em> changed, not the actual values. Floating point values are still binary approximations of real numbers, and binary fractions don't always add up to the <em>exact</em> number represented.</p>

<p>If you need to have more precision than what <code>float</code> approximations offer you, you need to switch to using the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>decimal.Decimal()</code> type</a> instead. This maintains precision, at the cost of speed (floating point arithmetic is handled in hardware on modern computers).</p>

The reason for wanting TAI is that I need a timestamp which is monotonically increasing, which I believe TAI fulfils (even during both positive &amp; negative leap seconds, since it <strike>doesn't care about leap seconds</strike> counts all seconds equally, including leap seconds).</p>

<p>Having read about POSIX / Unix time from various sources it's still not clear to me exactly what happens in Unix Time over a leap second. I know the Unix Time is ambiguous in terms of referring to a UTC Time, but I'm not clear on what happens in Unix Time in the instant a leap second occurs? Does Unix Time 'pause' or go backwards for example? And perhaps more importantly, even if it shouldn't according to the Unix Time spec, do Unix implementations actually obey the spec regarding leap seconds...?</p>

<p>Finally, Am I correct in saying that System.currentTimeMillis() will get the equivalent of POSIX Time (albeit in milliseconds rather than seconds)?</p>

<p>Note, I need an object which is portable across JVMs and machines (ruling out System.nanoTime() or similar).</p>

<p><strong>[CONCLUSION]</strong></p>

<p><strong>TAI</strong><br />
TAI is a system of measuring time where every second is counted and 'all seconds are equal' - ie. every second consists of the same period of time, and all seconds (including leap seconds) are counted in the total. This means the number of seconds in TAI (counted from some arbitrary start point, the Unix Epoch for example) is a monotonically increasing integer.</p>

<p><strong>POSIX Time</strong><br />
POSIX Time is a standard (NOT an implementation) for measuring time. It defines every day as having exactly 86400 seconds. Therefore, POSIX time does not count leap seconds (since occasionally a minute may have 61 seconds, leading to days with >86400 seconds, and theoretically a minute could have 59 seconds, leading to days with &lt;86400 seconds). This means that 'seconds' in POSIX have variable length, and shortly before / during / after leap seconds, a POSIX clock may skip seconds or repeat them. Specifically, the POSIX spec as referenced by Meno Hochschild in his answer states, ""The relationship between the actual time of day and the current value for seconds since the Epoch is unspecified.""</p>

<p><strong>UTC</strong><br />
UTC is a time standard which is related to the way the Earth moves around the Sun, aiming to maintain the relationship between the position of the Sun and the time of day (within a threshold). Ie in a UTC+0 region of the Earth, the Sun is always at its highest at midday UTC time. Leap Seconds (positive or negative) are necessary because the speed of the Earth's rotation is not fixed, and it does not vary in a predictable way (meaning we cannot predict when leap seconds will be necessary - or whether they will be positive leap seconds or negative leap seconds)</p>

<p><strong>Representing Times</strong><br />
It seems to me that both TAI and POSIX are representations of 'counts of seconds' (ie. something easy for a computer to actually store), whereas UTC is a 'human interpretation' of time (ie. Year/Month/Day Hour:Minute:Second.millisecond) that is not usually stored internally by a computer.</p>

<p><strong>Translating Times</strong><br />
Given the above, there are a number of issues translating from POSIX (without any leap seconds counted) to TAI (with leap seconds counted):</p>

<ol>
<li>It requires maintaining a table / count of leap seconds to translate any POSIX Time to a TAI Time</li>
<li>Even if point 1 is addressed, the POSIX Spec as above makes no guarantee about what will happen <em>during</em> a leap second, so at such times we have no way of accurately representing an unambiguous time</li>
<li>If a number of systems must communicate, passing timestamps between them, we must guarantee that the table / count of leap seconds is kept consistent</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, it is easy to convert from POSIX to the UTC 'human interpretation'. It doesn't require knowledge of leap seconds, since it just assumes every day has the same number of seconds (albeit some of these 'seconds' have different lengths of time in reality). In practice, you would just use the inverse of the formula in the POSIX Spec to obtain various the UTC components of time (again, see the POSIX spec referenced by Meno Hochschild).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Correction and detailed remarks to newly posted questions of OP:</strong></p>

<p>a) Yes, TAI is monotonically increasing in units of SI-seconds even during leap seconds. If it is only that what you wants you might choose TAI, but there is a pitfall. If you want to describe civil timestamps then TAI will give you wrong timestamps (just compare the first and the second column of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia diagram</a>). The reason is simply that civil life is ruled by UTC, not TAI.</p>

<p>b) About my comments that Wikipedia diagram is wrong, I have looked again at it very closely and changed my mind. The relation between POSIX and TAI is not fixed (10s offset only in 1972), so please excuse my error. Until now I have not thought so much about TAI, rather about POSIX and UTC. But thanks for the question and this enlightening debate so you deserve my upvote. The whole thing is tricky. When we talk about timestamps represented in different time scales we need to make a difference between the ymdhms-form and the epochsecs-form. Let's consider it in detail for the time 1999-01-01T00:00:00Z (UTC-scale):</p>

<pre><code>  i) TAI = (29 * 365 + 7) days * 86400 + 22 leap seconds + 10s (offset at 1972) = 915148832
 ii) UTC = TAI - 10 = 915148822 (fixed relation between UTC and TAI on epoch-second-level)
iii) POSIX = UTC - 22 leap seconds = 915148800

=&gt; (ymdhms-form);
  i) TAI (915148800 + 32) = 1999-01-01T00:00:32 (based on TAI-""day"" = 86400 SI-secs)
 ii) UTC = 1999-01-01T00:00:00 (stripped off former 22 leap secs in conversion to ymdhms)
iii) POSIX = 1999-01-01T00:00:00 (fixed relation between UTC and POSIX with exception of leapsecs)
</code></pre>

<p>So why the statement that TAI does not count leap seconds? It does not count leapsecs in ymdhms-form, but of course it counts them on epoch-second-level (monotonicity requirement!). And POSIX? It does not count leap seconds at all, neiter in ymdhms-form nor on epoch-secs-level. So finally we have no fixed relation between TAI and POSIX. A leap second table is required for conversion.</p>

<p>c) What does POSIX spec tell about leap second behaviour? See <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_14"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Especially note the statement: ""The relationship between the actual time of day and the current value for seconds since the Epoch is unspecified."" So this concerns the leap second, too. It is up to clock implementations if they jump before the leap second or jump after or freeze for one second.</p>

<p>d) Yes, <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> will get the equivalent of POSIX Time (albeit in milliseconds rather than seconds).</p>

<p>e) Just to note, the label TAI is not defined before 1971 and International Atomic Time not before 1958, so the proleptic scale of threeten-extra-class TAIInstant is somehow nonsense. So I would not apply TAI before 1972. Here I go with Steve Allen, the expert in time scales.</p>

<p>f) If you need a time object which is ""portable across JVMs and machines"" then UTC itself requires the distribution/existence of the same leap second table everywhere. If you choose TAI you still need this leap second table in order to enable applications to convert TAI-timestamps into UTC- or POSIX timestamps. So I doubt that you can have a monotonically increasing timestamp and ignore leap seconds simultaneously. TAI does not offer a solution for this dilemma.</p>

<p><strong>Answers to question/summary of OP from 2013-12-31:</strong></p>

<p>Your summaries about TAI and POSIX are correct. </p>

<p>About UTC, you should above all understand that UTC is a compromise. On the one side it is designed to follow the sun, on the other side the second on UTC scale is exactly the same as on TAI scale, namely the SI-second (atomic definition). You are right when you stated that the earth rotation speed is unpredicably slowing down, so leap seconds are some few times inserted. The difference between UT1 (mean solar time) and UTC shall always be smaller than 0.9 SI-seconds. So this and the fact of equal SI seconds are the core ideas of UTC. As an aside, the adaptation of the exotic UTC-SLS scale in JSR-310 is not compatible with these core ideas of UTC. About predictability of leap seconds, the BIPM in Paris announces every half year if 6 months later there will be a leap second necessary or not, so you have this predictability frame of six months in advance.</p>

<p>One maybe pedantic correction about UTC section, you wrote: ""the Sun is always at its highest at midday UTC time."" A similar statement is also given in the javadoc of class java.time.Instant about the so called java time-scale. Left aside the fact, that you surely not wanted to say that the position of the sun is independent from your local position, it is not even correct at the right longitude at midday. Why? From an astronomic/scientific point of view you should first not forget that the mean solar sun time is not the same as the true local solar time which you watch (just giving the keyword ""equation of time""). Furthermore, since UTC is still based on atomic time and uses atomic time for synchronization, there is a so called delta-T-relation between UT1 and UTC. This delta is within the frame of 0.9secs and is published regularly by IERS/BIPM in the bulletin B. You need to know this delta when you want to get the real position of the sun and when the sun is highest.</p>

<p>The section ""Representing Times"" is in my opinion a little bit too simple. Okay, we can say that TAI and POSIX count seconds while UTC is rather represented in year/month/day/...-form. But we can indeed apply both representations to all scales. But we need to carefully differentiate between these representations and think thoroughly about how to convert. Note that Wikipedia has even choosen the ymdhms-form for TAI in the diagrams. Well, computers can best store simple integers. And POSIX or TAI can easily be stored in that format. But as I said before, the interpretation of these integers is not always simple. In case of TAI you even need a leap second table to convert to readable civil ymdhms-form (either UTC or POSIX).</p>

<p>About the next section ""Translating Times"", I agree with points 1-3.</p>

<p>Your final statement ""On the other hand, it is easy to convert from POSIX to the UTC 'human interpretation'."" is right with exception of leap seconds. Well, I enable a suitable translation between the different scales with my coming library. It has a built-in but configurable leap second table, and in future I also plan to use IANA-TZDB-data as source for such a table.</p>

<p>All in all be aware of the fact that most business developers have no need for so much accuracy. Most people will simply equalize POSIX and UTC and will probably be satisfied with any smoothing hardware solutions in Linux OS or on Google NTP servers. True UTC and TAI (that is taking in account leap seconds) require more efforts. So you have to decide if your software architecture needs scientific accuracy.</p>

<p>And just to note, JSR-310 officially does not address the very wide-spread scale POSIX at all, instead they say, their class Instant shall be UTC-SLS by definition (see also this interesting <a href=""https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/issues/343"" rel=""nofollow"">debate</a>).</p>

<p>Finally I am graceful for this discussion. It has also helped me to clarify my thoughts about TAI in my library. Thanks.</p>

<p>However, there are some libraries that backport some of the stream functionality</p>

"2773866","2010-05-05 14:01:50","604","","","","<p>While you can use <code>rand(42-10) + 10</code> to get a random number between <code>10</code> and <code>42</code> (where 10 is inclusive and 42 exclusive), there's a better way since Ruby 1.9.3, where you are able to call:</p>

<pre><code>rand(10...42) # =&gt; 13
</code></pre>

<p>Available for all versions of Ruby by requiring my <a href=""http://github.com/marcandre/backports"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>backports</code></a> gem.</p>

<p>Ruby 1.9.2 also introduced the <code>Random</code> class so you can create your own random number generator objects and has a nice API:</p>

<pre><code>r = Random.new
r.rand(10...42) # =&gt; 22
r.bytes(3) # =&gt; ""rnd""
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Random</code> class itself acts as a random generator, so you call directly:</p>

<pre><code>Random.rand(10...42) # =&gt; same as rand(10...42)
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Notes on <code>Random.new</code></em></strong></p>

<p>In most cases, the simplest is to use <code>rand</code> or <code>Random.rand</code>. Creating a new random generator each time you want a random number is a <em>really bad idea</em>. If you do this, you will get the random properties of the initial seeding algorithm which are atrocious compared to the properties of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister"" rel=""noreferrer"">random generator itself</a>.</p>

<p>If you use <code>Random.new</code>, you should thus call it <em>as rarely as possible</em>, for example once as <code>MyApp::Random = Random.new</code> and use it everywhere else.</p>

<p>The cases where <code>Random.new</code> is helpful are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are writing a gem and don't want to interfere with the sequence of <code>rand</code>/<code>Random.rand</code> that the main programs might be relying on</li>
<li>you want separate reproducible sequences of random numbers (say one per thread)</li>
<li>you want to be able to save and resume a reproducible sequence of random numbers (easy as <code>Random</code> objects can marshalled)</li>

  <p>But on ""takePicture"" it will crash with the preview must be opened first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is possible that this reflects a bug somewhere in the library. Are you sure that you are not calling <code>takePicture()</code> too soon? If it is tied to a button, usually the preview will show up first. I have <a href=""https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera/issues/179"" rel=""nofollow"">an outstanding issue</a> to add better callbacks to let you know when it is safe to call <code>takePicture()</code> (e.g., to enable/disable a button).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would I position the camera preview at a specific position</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same way you would any other widget: put the <code>CameraFragment</code> or <code>CameraView</code> inside some container, with <code>android:layout_*</code> attributes (plus attributes on the container) that control its position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or inside another fragment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have not tried <code>CameraFragment</code> with nested fragments. In theory, this should work out of the box on API Level 17+. Nested fragments prior to that require the Android Support package's backport of fragments, so you would want to clone <code>CameraFragment</code> and change its superclass to be <code>android.support.v4.app.Fragment</code> and fix up other methods as needed. If you happen to be using ActionBarSherlock, the <code>CameraFragment</code> in the <code>camera-v9</code> project uses <code>SherlockFragment</code>, which in turn uses the fragment backport.</p>

"61543888","2020-05-01 13:58:13","1","","","","<h2>java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>Allow me to suggest that you use java.time, the modern Java date and time API, for your date work.</p>

<pre><code>    YearMonth currentMonth = YearMonth.of(2020, Month.APRIL);
    YearMonth backThen = currentMonth.minusYears(1).minusMonths(2);

    String formatMonth = backThen.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""MMM""));
    String formatYear = backThen.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""yy""));

    System.out.printf(""Month %s; year %s%n"", formatMonth, formatYear);
</code></pre>

<p>Output on my computer is (locale dependent):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Month feb.; year 19</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the sake of a reproducible example I hardcoded the year and month. To start from the current month in some time zone use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    YearMonth currentMonth = YearMonth.now(ZoneId.of(""Europe/Minsk""));
</code></pre>

<h2>What went wrong in your code?</h2>

<p>It’s the poor and confusing design of the <code>Calendar</code> and <code>GregorianCalendar</code> classes.</p>

<p>You said you ran your code on 29/apr/2020. This causes your <code>Calendar</code> to be set back to 29th February 2019. This date does not exist; there were only 28 days in February last year. Instead <code>Calendar</code> picks the day after February 28, that is, March 1. Causing you to get an incorrect month.</p>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Spanned fromHtml = HtmlCompat.fromHtml(context, source, 0);
// You may want to provide an ImageGetter, TagHandler and SpanCallback:
//Spanned fromHtml = HtmlCompat.fromHtml(context, source, 0,

textView.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());
textView.setText(fromHtml);

"24538996","2014-07-02 18:59:57","4","","","","<p>You have an I/O bound process, so to speed it up you will need to send requests concurrently.  This doesn't necessarily require multiple processors, you just need to avoid waiting until one request is done before sending the next.</p>

<p>There are a number of solutions for this problem. Take a look at <a href=""https://medium.com/p/40e9b2b36148"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog post</a> or check out <a href=""http://www.gevent.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">gevent</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">asyncio</a> (backports to pre-3.4 versions of Python should be available) or another async IO library.</p>

<p>However, when scraping other sites, you must remember: you can send requests very fast with concurrent programming, but depending on what site you are scraping, this may be very rude.  You could easily bring a small site serving dynamic content down entirely, forcing the administrators to block you.  Respect <code>robots.txt</code>, try to spread your efforts between multiple servers at once rather than focusing your entire bandwidth on a single server, and carefully throttle your requests to single servers unless you're sure you don't need to.</p>

"61561192","2020-05-02 14:44:32","0","","","","<p>gpx is a special xml essentially. What you're talking about is the <strong>XML Namespace</strong>.</p>

<p>How to create it: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39612625/ho-to-create-xml-header"">ho to create XML header</a></p>

<p>A xml file can only have one root element, but there are so many <code>trkpt</code> elements in a gpx file. So <code>trkpt</code> item should not be a root element. You should include all <code>trkpt</code> elements in a single <code>gpx</code> element, which is the root element of your gpx file. </p>

<p>To generate a gpx file in Android, the better choice is using a library. Most of them can help you conduct all the above operations. </p>

<p>I'm using <code>io.jenetics.jpx</code> in my android project and it works fine.</p>

<p>XML doesn't support appending elements. If you want to generate a gpx file while logging, you should do this in an appendable form, such as any <code>Serializable</code> type. After finishing logging you can create a valid GPX file from the Serialization file.</p>

<p>The <code>WayPoint</code> in jpx is a Serializable type, I'm using it.</p>

<p>You can also use Android <code>Location</code>, which implements <code>Parcelable</code>, the android implementation like Serializable.</p>

Here's a side-by-side example.</p>
<p>JDK7:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/60gep.png"" alt=""JDK7 javadoc look"" /></p>
<p>JDK8:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RpSJN.png"" alt=""JDK8 javadoc look"" /></p>
<p>JDK8 takes up considerable more space. It now uses the DejaVu font where Arial was previously used. There may be good reasons for that. I don't know.</p>
<p>My biggest problem is in the &quot;Parameters&quot; and &quot;Throws&quot; sections where there's no longer any visual difference between the argument and its description. They are both in a mono spaced font. Writing descriptive text in mono spaced font is just ugly, I think. Mono spaced font is for names of identifiers, source code listings and the like. (feel free to disagree).</p>
<p>Can I get the JDK7 style back while still using the JDK8 javadoc tool?</p>
<p>I was hoping for something like <code>javadoc -stylesheet jdk7.css</code> where <code>jdk7.css</code> was something included with the JDK8. Also if I decide to customize the css on my own (not my thing, but there may be no other solution) I would hate to have to ensure availability of the new stylesheet on every build server in our enterprise. Perhaps there's a Maven solution for that ?</p>
<h2>POSSIBLE SOLUTION ?</h2>
<p>It has been suggested (below) to use the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/stylesheet.css"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JDK7 javadoc css</a> with the JDK8 javadoc tool to see if that would bring back some eligible Javadoc.</p>
<p>I've done my test by checking out the source code from the Apache Commons Lang project. I use <em>only</em> the source code, not their POM. This is to ensure that I know I'm working off the right base.</p>
<p>Okay, first - for reference - here's the Javadoc which has been produced by an all JDK7 toolchain (JDK7 javadoc tool, JDK7 css). Here's the POM snippet:</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-javadoc-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;stylesheetfile&gt;${basedir}/src/main/css/jdk7javadoc.css&lt;/stylesheetfile&gt;  
                &lt;javadocExecutable&gt;C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_55/bin&lt;/javadocExecutable&gt;   
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;  
</code></pre>
<p>and the resulting Javadoc:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqiVc.png"" alt=""JDK7 javadoc, JDK7 css"" /></p>
<p>Next, the attempt to use the JDK7 css with the JDK8 javadoc tool. Here's the POM snippet:</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-javadoc-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;stylesheetfile&gt;${basedir}/src/main/css/jdk7javadoc.css&lt;/stylesheetfile&gt;  
                &lt;javadocExecutable&gt;C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_05/bin&lt;/javadocExecutable&gt;   
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;  
</code></pre>
<p>and the resulting Javadoc:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DX7Er.png"" alt=""JDK8 javadoc, JDK7 css"" /></p>
<p>So, as you can see, this strategy did not work out for me.</p>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>I've just realized that a consequence of this change is that it has become pointless to use <code>{@code }</code> (or <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>) markup on parameter descriptions. It doesn't show anyway. In other words if you liked to do like this in past:</p>
<pre><code>/**
* ...
* @param eName the name for the entity or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; to use the default
* ...
*/
</code></pre>
<p>there's simply no point to that anymore. Your <code>null</code> text will not stand out anyway.</p>
<h1>UPDATE 2019-04-19</h1>
<p>Parts of the problems mentioned above has been fixed in <a href=""https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8072052"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JDK-8072052 : &lt;dd&gt; part of &lt;dl&gt; list in javadoc should not be in monospace font</a>. Fixed in Java 9 onwards, not backported to Java 8.</p>

<p>While it is similar to the framework's Html class, some signature changes were required to allow more callbacks. Here's the sample from the GitHub page:</p>

// You may want to provide an ImageGetter, TagHandler and SpanCallback:

Based on the source code <a href=""https://github.com/felicesyforrados/suds/blob/master/suds/sax/text.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, <code>suds.sax.text.Text</code> is a subclass of Unicode.  You can write this to a file as you would a normal string but whatever you use to read the data from the file may corrupt it unless it's UTF-8-encoded.</p>

<p>You can try writing your <code>Text</code> object to a UTF-8-encoded file using <code>io.open</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import io
with io.open('/path/to/my/file.txt', 'w', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    f.write(FileString)
</code></pre>

<p>Bear in mind, your console or text editor may have trouble displaying non-ASCII characters but that doesn't mean they're not encoded properly.  Another way to inspect them is to open the file back up in the Python interactive shell:</p>

<pre><code>import io
with io.open('/path/to/my/file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    next(f) # displays the representation of the first line of the file as a Unicode object
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3, you can even use the built-in <code>csv</code> to parse the file, however in Python 2, you'll need to <code>pip install backports.csv</code> because the built-in module doesn't work with Unicode objects:</p>

<pre><code>from backports import csv
import io
with io.open('/path/to/my/file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    r = csv.reader(f)

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

  <p><code>onPostResume()</code> was not quoted as life cycle method.</p>
  
  <p>But I feel that this method is important method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most probably your feelings are wrong. And my answer on why it is so is a bit long and kind of abstract.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract (but important) part</strong></p>

<p>Typically various <code>onPreXyz</code> and <code>onPostXyz</code> (aka <code>onBeforeXyz</code> and <code>onAfterXyz</code>) methods are an attempt to make a base class open to extension by subclasses but still preserving some important behavior aspects. Assume that you are designing you own base class and you have a lifecycle event ""Xyz"" and your default handling behavior is following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do some initialization before any other handling</li>
<li>Do actual handling of event including customizable logic</li>
<li>When all customizable handling is done do some finishing logic</li>
</ol>

<p>Now assume that you are making something like <code>Activity</code> class - a base class with some bits of logic and the one that would be heavily inherited from, probably with deep hierarchies of inheritance. Now you should think of where (when) sub-classes logic will be exectuted regarding to logic in your base class. The important tricky part here is that you want your sub-classes to put their additional logic around step #2 (i.e. after #1 and before #3). You can't easily achieve this goal with simple virtual method because subclass can either put their logic after call to <code>super</code> which is after #3 or (rarely) before <code>super</code> call i.e. before #1. So what would you do? The <a href=""https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Template method pattern</a> comes to the rescue. You orgainze you code in a following way</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>class Activity {
    public final void performXyz(XyzEventData eventData) {
       onPreXyz(eventData);
       onXyz(eventData);
       onPostXyz(eventData);
    }

    protected void onPreXyz(XyzEventData eventData) {
       // put you logic from step #1 here
    }

    protected void onXyz(XyzEventData eventData) {
       // put you logic from step #2 here
    }

    protected void onPostXyz(XyzEventData eventData) {
       // put you logic from step #3 here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So you have single external entry point <code>performXyz</code> that is called by the whatever context generates lifecycle events when the Xyz event happens and it dispatches the event internally to 3 different methods enforcing some sequence of execution. Typically you put all your code in your subclasses inside the ""main"" <code>onXyz</code> method unless you have a good reason to put it in one of the two others i.e. you expect your class to be subclassed as well and you want to ensure some execution order. </p>

<p>There are a few more points worth noting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Entry-point method <code>performXyz</code> is <code>final</code> (i.e.  non-virtual). In this way you ensure that nobody can override it and break your execution order enforcement logic.</p></li>
<li><p>The base class might even leave <code>onPreXyz</code> and <code>onPostXyz</code>
methods empty by putting its steps #1 and #3 logic directly into <code>performXyz</code>. But if the designer of the base class expects possible deep inheritance hierarchies where some intermediate sub-class, that will be a base class for many other deeper subclasses (such as <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/layerSupertype.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Layer supertype</a>), might need the same execution order enforcement feature, it makes sense to provide such methods in the base class anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the <code>onPreXyz</code> or <code>onPostXyz</code> method might be
omitted altogether if your case doesn't require 3-steps execution
separation and 2-steps are enough. This is what often happens in Android: there are much more <code>onPostXyz</code> methods than <code>onPreXyz</code> but <code>AsyncTask</code> seems to be one noticible exception that feature both of them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Closer look at Android</strong> (and onPostResume)</p>

<p>So after this long introduction, how Android uses this approach for <code>onPostResume</code>? If you look at the code at <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.1_r1/android/app/Activity.java#Activity.onPostResume%28%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Activity.onPostResume</code></a> you'll notice that it does very few things in the base class and the ones that are tightly related to UI stuff and probably expect all data-structures to be fully ready. This of course is not very surprising.</p>

<p>What is more interesting is how it is used in the subclasses. One of the very few overrides is at <code>FragmentActivity</code> from the v4 support library which provides backported ""Fragments"" features for old devices. <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.1_r1/android/support/v4/app/FragmentActivity.java#FragmentActivity.onPostResume%28%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>FragmentActivity.onPostResume</code></a> contains logic to resume child fragments. You may notice that in the standard <code>Activity</code> class similar logic to resume fragments is put directly into <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.1_r1/android/app/Activity.java#6086"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>performResume</code></a> method between <code>mInstrumentation.callActivityOnResume(this);</code> and <code>onPostResume();</code> calls so it seems to be a part of step #3 in my earlier abstract description just put into the caller code. Obviously <code>FragmentActivity</code> can't put any new code to the <code>Activity.performResume</code> to ensure that it will be executed after activity's resume is done. Thus it puts the logic to the overridden <code>FragmentActivity.onPostResume</code> and in this way preserves the same semantics that fragments should be resumed after activity has already been resumed. Note also that the fact that this semantics explicitly preserved in both <code>Activity</code> and <code>FragmentActivity</code> classes suggests that this is the way it better should be. So if your code actually uses fragments, you'd better <strong><em>not put</em></strong> extensive logic into your <code>onPostResume</code> or something bad might happen (not sure what exactly).</p>

See <a href=""https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5876"" rel=""noreferrer"">this issue</a> for details.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Full answer:</strong></p>
<p>I think the closest feature to what you're asking for is <a href=""https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocols.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Protocol</code></a>, which was introduced in Python 3.8 (and backported to older Pythons via <a href=""https://github.com/python/typing/tree/master/typing_extensions"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>typing_extensions</code></a>). It allows you to define a <code>Protocol</code> subclass that describes the behaviors of the type, pretty much like an &quot;interface&quot; or &quot;trait&quot; in other languages. For functions, a similar syntax is supported:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from typing import Protocol
# from typing_extensions import Protocol  # if you're using Python 3.6

class MyFunction(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, a: Any, b: Any, **kwargs) -&gt; bool: ...

def decorator(func: MyFunction):
    ...

@decorator  # this type-checks
def my_function(a, b, **kwargs) -&gt; bool:
    return a == b

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, any function that have a matching signature can match the <code>MyFunction</code> type.</p>
<p>However, this is not sufficient for your requirements. In order for the function signatures to match, the function must be able to accept <strong>an arbitrary number of keyword arguments</strong> (i.e., have a <code>**kwargs</code> argument). To this point, there's still no way of specifying that the function may (optionally) take any keyword arguments. <a href=""https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5876"" rel=""noreferrer"">This GitHub issue</a> discusses some possible (albeit verbose or complicated) solutions under the current restrictions.</p>
<hr />
<p>For now, I would suggest just using <code>Callable[..., bool]</code> as the type annotation for <code>f</code>. It is possible, though, to use <code>Protocol</code> to refine the return type of the wrapper:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>class ReturnFunc(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, s: str, **kwargs) -&gt; bool: ...

def comparator(f: Callable[..., bool]) -&gt; ReturnFunc:
    ....
</code></pre>
<p>This gets rid of the &quot;unexpected keyword argument&quot; error at <code>equal_within(&quot;5.0 4.99998&quot;, rel_tol=1e-5)</code>.</p>
","2","4909228",""
"24575668","2014-07-04 13:39:53","0","","","","<p>If you want to make it your own way, look for <code>click</code> events on the plus and minus buttons, change an integer variable (say <code>mQuantity</code>) according to these click event (<code>mQuantity++</code> or <code>mQuantity--</code> respectively), and change the <code>TextView</code> content with <code>mQuantityLabel.setText(mQuantity+"""");</code>. That extra <code>+""""</code> is to avoid <code>setText</code> looking for a probably non existing <code>id</code> inside <code>strings.xml</code>. You could just need to convert the int to String, but this suffices for this case.</p>

<p>However, and it may be more sensible to go for already established solutions for number increase/decrease such as <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/NumberPicker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NumberPicker</a> (after API 11) or <a href=""https://github.com/SimonVT/android-numberpicker"" rel=""nofollow"">SimonVT's NumberPicker</a> (backport of NumberPicker, if the minSdkVersion is prior to API 11). </p>

"61809830","2020-05-15 00:46:22","5","","","","<p>Current Deno release 1.0.0 (latest today) is not compatible with CentOS 7.</p>

<p>I tried on the latest distribution released on 27 April 2020:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS Linux release 7.8.2003 (Core)
</code></pre>

<p>This issue <a href=""https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1658"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7 GLIBC_2.18 not found</a> suggests that there should be a way to solve this problem, but the thread seems to be abandoned for a year.</p>

<p>As of today Deno requires <code>GLIBC_2.18</code>, but unfortunately CentOS 7 is running <code>2.17</code>, an old version of the gclib which is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>$ ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.17
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to run Deno on CentOS you'll need to use <code>CentOS 8</code>. Tested it and it works.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/537694/251249"">How to fix “/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That means the program was compiled against glibc version 2.14, and it
  requires that version to run, but your system has an older version
  installed. You'll need to either recompile the program against the
  version of glibc that's on your system, or install a newer version of
  glibc (the ""libc6"" package in Debian).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will not happen for CentOS 7. From <a href=""https://forums.centos.org/viewtopic.php?t=71740"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glibc_2.18 on Centos 7</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. Never going to happen. We ship glibc 2.17 as part of CentOS 7 and
  that will never change. It's part of the basic RHEL standards that
  stuff like this does not change within a major version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't count on Deno — which is a new technology — to backport with old compilers. Consider upgrading your servers to CentOS 8.</p>

            .toLocalDateTime()
            .toString();
</code></pre>

<p>I am assuming you have got the client’s time zone as an offset in hours and minutes. Then you can pass those into from <code>ZoneOffset.ofHoursMinutes()</code>. Beware that if the client time zone uses summer time (daylight savings time) some of the year (as is the case in greater parts of the USA), you need to be sure you get the offset for the time of year where the date falls. Other ways of specifying the client time zone would be  <code>ZoneId.systemDefault()</code> or <code>ZoneId.of(""Asia/Kolkata"")</code> — such would know the summer time rules and hence may be safer.</p>

<p>The code prints:</p>

<pre><code>2017-03-24T11:31:33

<p>You notice it’s five and a half hours ahead of the input string as expected.</p>

<p>If you only require the date, not the time, use <code>toLocalDate()</code> instead of <code>toLocalDateTime()</code>.</p>

<p>All of the above requires Java 8.

Then, in order to perform simultaneous animations with Animators you may use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/AnimatorSet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">AnimatorSet</a> class (playTogether method). If you need to support old Android versions there is a <a href=""http://nineoldandroids.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">NineOldAndroids</a> library which backports Animators. Another way (without animators) is to use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/AnimationSet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">AnimationSet</a> (again you should add Animations for each view you want to move) class and implement <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/Animation.AnimationListener.html"" rel=""nofollow"">AnimationListener</a> changing the Layoutparams of your views (in order to update layout)</p>

Also you might have luck with ruby enterprise edition fork of 1.8.7 which backports some memory management fixes from 1.9 (like allowing the VM to shrink when it's using less memory) - that change might have worked it's way back to normal 1.8.7 though, although I am not sure. The claim with REE is that you can reduce memory consumption with 33% for rails applications.</p>

<p>Ruby stuff generally tend to grow over time and need rebooting, with passenger it does that automatically for you. It's worked perfectly for me so I can really recommend it.</p>

<h3>An unofficial runtime patch is available for earlier versions</h3>

<p>Thanks to the research in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24427356/2390644"">Holger's answer</a>, I was able to develop a runtime patch and my employer has released it free under the terms of the GPLv2 license <em>with Classpath Exception</em><sup>1</sup> (the same as the OpenJDK source code).</p>

<p>The patch project and source code is <a href=""https://github.com/PROSPricing/jdk8patch-halfupround/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hosted on GitHub</a> with more details about this bug as well as links to downloadable binaries.  The patch makes no modifications to the installed Java files on disk, and it should be safe for use on all versions of Oracle Java >= 6 and at least through version 8 (including fixed versions).</p>

<p>When the patch detects bytecode signatures that suggest the bug is present, it replaces the <code>HALF_UP</code> switch case with a revised implementation:</p>

<pre><code>if (digits[maximumDigits] &gt; '5') {
    return true;
} else if (digits[maximumDigits] == '5') {
    return maximumDigits != (count - 1)
        || allDecimalDigits
        || !alreadyRounded;
}
// else
return false; // in original switch(), was: break;
</code></pre>

<p><sup>1</sup> I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that <em>GPLv2 w/ CPE</em> allows commercial use in <em>binary form</em> without GPL applying to the combined work.</p>

<h2>java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>I Java because this is what I can write.</p>

<pre><code>    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; dateList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(1, 5, 2020));

    LocalDate date = LocalDate
            .of(dateList.get(2), dateList.get(1), dateList.get(0));

    System.out.println(""Date: "" + date);
</code></pre>

<p>Output is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Date: 2020-05-01</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>LocalDate</code> (opposite <code>Calendar</code>) numbers months sanely, so 5 is May. If you intended June, don’t use the literal 5, it would be very confusing. If you cannot use 6 for June, use the built-in constant <code>Calendar.JUNE</code>. And remember to add 1 when passing to <code>LocalDate.of()</code>.</p>

<p>Since you need the date as a <code>Calendar</code> object for your date picker, we need to convert. A <code>Calendar</code> object includes time of day and time zone and more, so is really overkill, but we need to obey the date picker API, of course. It’s conventional to use the start of the day in the JVM’s time zone.</p>

<pre><code>    ZonedDateTime startOfDay = date.atStartOfDay(ZoneId.systemDefault());
    Calendar oldfashionedCalendar = DateTimeUtils.toGregorianCalendar(startOfDay);

    System.out.println(oldfashionedCalendar.getTime());
</code></pre>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in. Only in this case don’t use <code>DateTimeUtils</code> for the conversion, use the slightly simpler <code>GregorianCalendar.from(startOfDay)</code>.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p><strong>Longer Answer</strong></p>

<p>I know this question isn't really about whether or not to extend built-in objects, but the attempt of the OP and the comments on this answer highlight that debate. My comment from Feb 12, '13 cites an article that outlines this debate really well, however that link broke and I can't edit the original comment because too much time has passed, so I include it <a href=""http://perfectionkills.com/extending-native-builtins/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're looking to extend the built-in <code>Array</code> object with a <code>contains</code> method, probably the best and most responsible way to do this would be to use this polyfill from <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN</a>. (See also <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain#Bad_practice_Extension_of_native_prototypes"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> section of the MDN article on Prototypical inheritance, which explains that <em>""The only good reason for extending a built-in prototype is to backport the features of newer JavaScript engines; for example Array.forEach, etc.""</em>)</p>

<pre><code>if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function(searchElement /*, fromIndex*/ ) {
    'use strict';
    var O = Object(this);
    var len = parseInt(O.length) || 0;
    if (len === 0) {
      return false;
    }
    var n = parseInt(arguments[1]) || 0;
    var k;
    if (n &gt;= 0) {
      k = n;
    } else {
      k = len + n;
      if (k &lt; 0) {k = 0;}
    }
    var currentElement;
    while (k &lt; len) {
      currentElement = O[k];
      if (searchElement === currentElement ||
         (searchElement !== searchElement &amp;&amp; currentElement !== currentElement)) {
        return true;
      }
      k++;
    }
    return false;
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Don't want strict equality, or want to choose?</strong></p>

<pre><code>function includes(k, strict) {
  strict = strict !== false; // default is true
  // strict = !!strict; // default is false
  for(var i=0; i &lt; this.length; i++){
    if( (this[i] === k &amp;&amp; strict) || 
        (this[i] == k &amp;&amp; !strict) ||
        (this[i] !== this[i] &amp;&amp; k !== k)
    ) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

<p>Consider using java.time, the modern Java date and time API, for your time work. If for minSDK below API level 26, then through the backport, I will get back to that. First the code:</p>

<pre><code>    DateTimeFormatter timeFormatter
            = DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedTime(FormatStyle.MEDIUM);

    long sunriseUnixTs = 1_589_581_234;
    ZonedDateTime sunriseApplicationTz = Instant.ofEpochSecond(sunriseUnixTs)
            .atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault());

    System.out.println(""Sunrise: "" + sunriseApplicationTz.format(timeFormatter));
</code></pre>

<p>Output from this example snippet in my time zone and locale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sunrise: 03.50.34</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the things I find great about java.time is that the code makes it explicit that we are getting the time in the default time zone of the JVM where the application is running.</p>

<h2>What went wrong in your code?</h2>

<p>Adding the time zone offset of the city you are inquiring about is wrong. A Unix timestamp is independent of time zone. So if you multiply by 1000 and feed to <code>new Date(long)</code>, you are getting a <code>Date</code> that holds the correct point in time. If you add a non-zero offset, you are getting a wrong point in time. Your emulator gave you the expected result, why, then? It might be because the offset from JSON was 0 (zero) or because the error was balanced out by the emulator using a different default time zone from what you had expected.</p>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

"43076994","2017-03-28 18:14:46","5","","","","<p><strong>Preamble:</strong> </p>

<p>If you don't care about details then the accepted answer suggesting <code>DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""yyyy MM dd"");</code> is fine. Otherwise if you are interested in the tricky details of parsing then read further:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Regular expressions</strong></p>

<p>As you have already recognized, a complete validation is not possible by using regular expressions like <code>(19|20)\d\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])</code>. For example, this expression would accept ""2017-02-31"" (February with 31 days???).</p>

<p><strong>Java-8-parsing mechanism</strong></p>

<p>The Java-8-class <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> however, can invalidate such non-existing dates just by parsing. To go into the details, we have to differentiate between syntactic validation and calendrical validation. The first kind of syntactic validation is performed by the method <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#parseUnresolved-java.lang.CharSequence-java.text.ParsePosition-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parseUnresolved()</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation. First, the text is
  parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing a Map of
  field to value, a ZoneId and a Chronology. Second, the parsed data is
  resolved, by validating, combining and simplifying the various fields
  into more useful ones. This method performs the parsing stage but not
  the resolving stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main advantage of this method is to not use exception flow which makes this kind of parsing fast. However, the second step of parsing uses exception flow, see also the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-java.text.ParsePosition-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">javadoc</a> of the method <code>parse(CharSequence, ParsePosition)</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By contrast, this method will throw a DateTimeParseException if an
  error occurs, with the exception containing the error index. This
  change in behavior is necessary due to the increased complexity of
  parsing and resolving dates/times in this API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMHO a performancewise limitation. Another drawback is also that the currently available API does not allow to specify a dot OR a hyphen as you have done in your regular expression. The API only offers a construct like ""[.][-]"" (using optional sections), but the problem is that an input sequence of "".-"" would also be okay for Java-8.</p>

<p>Well, these minor disadvantages are mentioned here for completeness. A final almost-perfect solution would be in Java-8:</p>

<pre><code>String input = ""2017-02.-31"";
DateTimeFormatter dtf =
    DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""yyyy[.][-]MM[.][-]dd"").withResolverStyle(
        ResolverStyle.STRICT // smart mode truncates to Feb 28!
    );
ParsePosition pos = new ParsePosition(0);
TemporalAccessor ta = dtf.parseUnresolved(input, pos); // step 1
LocalDate date = null;
if (pos.getErrorIndex() == -1 &amp;&amp; pos.getIndex() == input.length()) {
    try {
        date = LocalDate.parse(input, dtf); // step 2
    } catch (DateTimeException dte) {
        dte.printStackTrace(); // in strict mode (see resolver style above)
    }
}
System.out.println(date); // 2017-02-28 in smart mode
</code></pre>

<p>Important: </p>

<ul>
<li>The best possible validation is only possible in strict resolver style.</li>
<li>The validation proposed also includes a check if there are trailing unparsed chars.</li>
<li>The result <code>ta</code> of method <code>parseUnresolved()</code> in step 1 cannot be used as intermediate result due to internal limitations of resolving. So this 2-step-approach is also not so overly good for performance. I have not benchmarked it against a normal 1-step-approach but hope that the main author of the new API (S. Colebourne) might have done it, see also for comparison his solution in his own <a href=""https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten-extra/commit/d7f88dcf354a43d656cba829bee79c5e4ffde12f#diff-c8c474197400b9a37b4992735241fb0eR173"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Threeten-extra-library</a>. More or less a hackish workaround to avoid exception flow as much as possible.</li>
<li>For Java 6+7, there is a <a href=""https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backport</a> available.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alternative</strong></p>

<p>If you look for an alternative but not for <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>, then you might also find my library <a href=""https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Time4J</a> interesting. It supports real OR-logic and avoids exception flow logic as much as possible (highly tuned parsing only in one step). Example:</p>

<pre><code>    String input = ""2017-02-31"";
    ParseLog plog = new ParseLog();
    PlainDate date =
        ChronoFormatter.ofDatePattern(
            ""uuuu-MM-dd|uuuu.MM.dd"", PatternType.CLDR, Locale.ROOT)
        .parse(input, plog); // uses smart mode by default and rejects feb 31 in this mode
    if (plog.isError()) {
        System.out.println(plog.getErrorMessage());
    } else {
        System.out.println(date);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A check of trailing characters can be included in the same way as in Java-8</li>
<li>The parsed result is easily convertible to <code>LocalDate</code> via <code>date.toTemporalAccessor()</code></li>
<li>Using the format attribute <code>Attributes.LENIENCY</code> would weaken the validation</li>
<li>Time4J is also available for Java 6+7 (when using version line v3.x)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/PluginContainerException"" rel=""nofollow"">deleting the local dependencies and the nexus dependencies</a>, but the error persists. If I change to jOOQ 3.1.0 the error disappears.</p>

<p>Using <code>JSONEnum</code> at the bottom of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/43730305/208880"">When should I subclass EnumMeta instead of Enum?</a>, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>class Country(JSONEnum):
    _init_ = 'abbr code country_name'  # remove if not using aenum
    _file = 'some_file.json'
    _name = 'alpha-2'
    _value = {
            1: ('alpha-2', None),
            2: ('country-code', lambda c: int(c)),
            3: ('name', None),
            }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2><em>Original Answer</em></h2>

<p>It looks like you are trying to keep track of three pieces of data:</p>

<ul>
<li>country name</li>
<li>country code</li>
<li>country 2-letter abbreviaton</li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider using a technique inspired by a <code>namedtuple</code> mixin as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/26703636/208880"">illustrated in this answer</a>:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The stdlib way</strong></p>

<p>We'll need a base class to hold the behavior:</p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum
import json

class BaseCountry(Enum):

    def __new__(cls, record):
        member = object.__new__(cls)
        member.country_name = record['name']
        member.code = int(record['country-code'])
        member.abbr = record['alpha-2']
        member._value_ = member.abbr, member.code, member.country_name
        if not hasattr(cls, '_choices'):
            cls._choices = {}
        cls._choices[member.code] = member.country_name
        cls._choices[member.abbr] = member.country_name
        return member                

    def __str__(self):
        return self.country_name

    @classmethod
    def choices(cls):
        return cls._choices.copy()
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can use that to create the actual <code>Country</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>Country = BaseCountry(
        'Country',
        [(rec['alpha-2'], rec) for rec in json.load(open('slim-2.json'))],
        )
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aenum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>aenum</code></a> way</strong> <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup></p>

<pre><code>from aenum import Enum, MultiValue
import json

class Country(Enum, init='abbr code country_name', settings=MultiValue):

    _ignore_ = 'this country'  # do not add these names as members

    # create members
    this = vars()
    for country in json.load(open('slim-2.json')):
        this[country['alpha-2']] = (
                country['alpha-2'],
                int(country['country-code']),
                country['name'],
                )

    # return a dict of choices by abbr or country code to name
    @classmethod
    def choices(cls):
        mapping = {}
        for member in cls:
            mapping[member.code] = member.name
            mapping[member.abbr] = member.name
        return mapping

    # have str() print just the country name
    def __str__(self):
        return self.country_name
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>While I included the <code>choices</code> method, you may not need it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Country('AF')
&lt;Country.AF: ('AF', 4, 'Afghanistan')&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Country(4)
&lt;Country.AF: ('AF', 4, 'Afghanistan')&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Country('Afghanistan')
&lt;Country.AF: ('AF', 4, 'Afghanistan')&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a Distribution here, and it is a partially Random one, but there is also Structure there.</p>

<p>I want to implement this in C#, and to be honest, I am not sure on an efficient way to do it.</p>

<p>Some 4 Years ago there was a good question asked: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11314908/emulate-pythons-random-choice-in-net/11314962#comment14891681_11314908"">Emulate Python&#39;s random.choice in .NET</a></p>

<p>Being this is quite old now and also does not really go into depth on the uniform probability distribution, I thought I would ask for some elaboration?</p>

<p>Now times have changed and Code is changing, I think there may be a better way to implement a .NET <code>Random.Choice()</code> Method.</p>

<pre><code>public static int Choice(Vector sequence, int a = 0, int size = 0, bool replace = false)
{
    // F(x)
    var Fx = 1/(b - a)
    var p = (xmax - xmin) * Fx

    return random.Next(0, sequence.Length);
}

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
After Coffee and sleep, some more insight. The Documentation explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without replacement:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
    array([2, 3, 0])</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The parameter <code>p</code> introduces a Non-Uniform Distribution to the sequence or Choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The probabilities associated with each entry in <code>a</code>. If not given the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all entries in <code>a</code>.</p>

    choice(a, size=None, replace=True, p=None)

    Generates a random sample from a given 1-D array

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    -----------
    a : 1-D array-like or int
        If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements.
        If an int, the random sample is generated as if a was np.arange(n)

    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. Default is None, in which case a single value is
        returned.

    replace : boolean, optional
        Whether the sample is with or without replacement.

    p : 1-D array-like, optional
        The probabilities associated with each entry in a.
        If not given the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all
        entries in a.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.


    Returns
    --------
    samples : 1-D ndarray, shape (size,)
    The generated random samples

    Raises
    -------
    ValueError
    If a is an int and less than zero, if a or p are not 1-dimensional,
    if a is an array-like of size 0, if p is not a vector of
    probabilities, if a and p have different lengths, or if
    replace=False and the sample size is greater than the population
    size

    Examples
    ---------
    Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.random.choice(5, 3)  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([0, 3, 4])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)

    Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([3, 3, 0])

    Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
    replacement:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False)  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([3,1,0])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; #This is equivalent to np.random.shuffle(np.arange(5))[:3]

    Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size
    3 without replacement:

<p>I am using <code>java.time.Year</code>, one of a number of date and time classes introduced in Java 8 (and also backported to Java 6 and 7). This is just one little example out of very many where the new classes are more convenient and lead to clearer code than the old classes <code>Calendar</code> and <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>.</p>
<p>If you just wanted the two-digit number, not as a string, you may use:<br /><code>Year.now().getValue() % 100</code>.</p>
<p>The other answers were good answers in 2013, but the years have moved on. :-)</p>
<p>Edit: New Year doesn’t happen at the same time in all time zones. To make the dependency on time zone clear in the code I would usually write <code>Year.now(myDesiredTimeZoneId)</code>, for example in the form <code>Year.now(ZoneId.systemDefault())</code>.</p>

<p>Hosting tends not to be that big of a deal with respect to new rails versions, however. It's the community. Gems, plugins, and systems come in and out of fashion at blinding speed in the Rails community and you can quickly find yourself committed to a pile of unmaintained contributed code. Most new gems now ONLY support Rails 3, so if you have a 2.x.x app and want to use those things, you're SOL unless you backport it yourself. </p>

<p>So yes, you are chasing Rails versions over the long period. There's 2 ways to solve it: either walk away from every app you write after it's finished, like a consultant, or keep your app small. If you want to build a large, feature-filled platform, you can't build it as one app. You'll get stuck on a Rails version forever and have to rewrite it eventually anyway. Just set a threshold and say when this app is over 10,000 lines, it's time to break it up into services so it doesn't get fossilized.</p>

<p>For unrelated constants I would use the <code>Constant</code> class found in <code>aenum</code><sup>1</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>class MiscellaneousConstants(Constant):

<p><code>Constant</code>s are similar to <code>Enum</code>s in that you cannot rebind them, and they have nice reprs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; MiscellaneousConstants.A
&lt;MiscellaneousConstants.A: 1&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; MiscellaneousConstants.A = 9
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
AttributeError: cannot rebind constant &lt;MiscellaneousConstants.A&gt;

<p>Typing the class name can be a bother, so to facilitate getting the <code>Constant</code> members into the global name space, <code>export</code> is provided:</p>

<pre><code>from aenum import Constant, export

@export(globals())
class MiscellaneousConstants(Constant):
    A = 1
    B = 2
</code></pre>

<p>and in use:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A
&lt;MiscellaneousConstants.A: 1&gt;

<p>Note that, as is normal for Python, names at the global level can still be rebound:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; A
9

<p><code>Constant</code> class members, however, are still constant:</p>

<p>And use it in your project, if you need to upload it to docker hub you will need to change the name accordingly. </p>

<p>I would not bother converting the <code>Instant</code> to a string explicitly. It prints in UTC in your desired format when you print it, thus implicitly invoking its <code>toString</code> method (the format is ISO 8601, the international standard).</p>

<p>Please fill in your desired time zone. To rely on the device’ time zone setting set <code>zone</code> to <code>ZoneId.systemDefault()</code>.</p>

<p>I am of course happy to use java.time, the modern Java date and time API. You can do that on your Android version too, see the details below.</p>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>That said, it should be done in middleware during request phase. The ResolverMatch instance is available in the WSGIRequest as request.resolver_match. Using the fix above, it's trivial to add a log to each request.</p>

<p>If you cannot backport or upgrade, there is a way to do it, which basically involves building a cache on start up of all known urlconfs and then matching each one and I've done it at some point, yet don't have it laying around any more. You basically have to do the work of URLResolver.resolve() and then add the route to it, when it creates the ResolverMatch instance. Hopefully this helps you get started.</p>

<p>I recommend that you use java.time, the modern Java date and time API, for your time math. You cannot use a <code>Date</code> for an amount of time. Instead use <code>LocalTime</code> for a time of day and <code>Duration</code> for a duration, an amount of time.</p>

<pre><code>    LocalTime dropOff = LocalTime.of(8, 30);
    System.out.println(""Drop-off: "" + dropOff);

    Duration timeToDest = Duration.ofMinutes(20);
    LocalTime end = dropOff.plus(timeToDest);
    System.out.println(""Time at destination: "" + end);

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Drop-off: 08:30
Time at destination: 08:50
</code></pre>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>

<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

"43527668","2017-04-20 18:53:10","2","","","","<p>Your problem is the ambiguity of CST. In most cases <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> understands CST as Central Standard Time as you had expected. But when your computer is running Shanghai Time, this becomes the time zone of the formatter’s calendar, and then it suddenly understands CST as China Standard Time, the same as Shanghai time.</p>

<p>Therefore <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/43523619/5772882"">Darshan Mehta’s solution</a>, setting <code>inputFormatter</code>’s time zone to something other than China Standard Time, works on my computer. I don’t know why it didn’t work on yours (I set it to <code>TimeZone.getTimeZone(""America/Chicago"")</code> to match the intended interpretation of CST).</p>

<p>The correct and good solution, though, is to avoid the three and four letter time zone abbreviations completely. Yours is just one example out of many where they cause trouble. If you can, give your input string with an explicit zone offset from UTC, such is never ambiguous:</p>

<pre><code>    String inputDate = ""01-19-2017 06:01 -0600"";
</code></pre>

<p>Now your code works as expected no matter your computer’s time zone setting. The <code>Z</code> in the pattern string you already have matches <code>-0600</code> nicely.</p>

<p>All of this said, if you can use the Java 8 date and time classes, you can do yourself a favour of switching over to them. I hesitate to call them “Java 8 date and time classes” because they have also been backported to Java 6 and 7, so if you can live with a library dependency until you get to Java 8, you should have every chance. The newer classes are significantly more programmer-friendly and convenient to work with. A simple example to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>    String inputDate = ""01-19-2017 06:01 -0600"";
    DateTimeFormatter inputFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm Z"");
    ZonedDateTime parsedInput = ZonedDateTime.parse(inputDate, inputFormatter);

    OffsetDateTime gmtTime = parsedInput.toOffsetDateTime().withOffsetSameInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC);
    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm a Z"");
    String formattedDate = gmtTime.format(formatter);
    System.out.println(formattedDate); // prints 01-19-2017 12:01 PM +0000

Android 3.1 also supports importing and calling the classes within this namespace to support applications written with the add-on library. This add-on library is a thin wrapper around the android.hardware.usb accessory APIs and does not support USB host mode. If you want to support the widest range of devices that support USB accessory mode, use the add-on library and import this package. It is important to note that not all Android 2.3.4 devices are required to support the USB accessory feature. Each individual device manufacturer decides whether or not to support this capability, which is why you must declare it in your manifest file.</p>

<p>It was fixed in Android 2.3 but has not been backported to earlier Android releases which is why you see the crash in Android 2.2.</p>

<p>To be more elaborate: if you run this code (an extended version of your own code) on Android 2.2 :</p>

<pre><code>public class ReproduceBugActivity extends Activity {
  private static final String TAG = ""ReproduceBugActivity"";
  private ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; mArrayList;

  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    try {
      String className = null;
      Field field = getClass().getDeclaredField(""mArrayList"");
      if (field.getType() == java.util.ArrayList.class)
        className = ((ParameterizedType)field.getGenericType()).toString();
      Log.i(TAG, ""className = "" + className);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will get this exception:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException

   at com.reproducebug.ReproduceBugActivity.onCreate(ReproduceBugActivity.java:23)
</code></pre>

<p>because of the above mentioned bug in the Java reflection implementation. On Android 2.3, the bug has been fixed, and you'll see this in the logcat instead:</p>

<pre><code>I/ReproduceBugActivity(23449): className = java.util.ArrayList&lt;java.lang.Object&gt;

<p>Every  1/4year, oracle releases bunch of fixes for openjdk. Red Hat engineers backport them for you to openjdk7. So jdk gets updated  aprox 4x per year in rhel 6.</p>

<p>Big deal is given in RedHat to keep rhel X compatible during its lifecycle, and java is no exception. So the update from 1.7.0_65 to 1.7.0_131 (guessing with 6.6->6.9 update) should be perfectly smooth. In unlike case of accident, it is case to red hat bugzilla xor custommer portal  and rh's OpenJDK team will do its best to fix it.</p>

<p>Long story short, is is very bad idea to have such old jdk on your system.</p>

"43536312","2017-04-21 07:19:17","0","","","","<p>RHEL 6.6, as initially released, has java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.65-2.5.1.2.el6_5. This version is based on OpenJDK 7u65 and IcedTea 2.5.1, released 2014-07-16. As such, it is over two and a half years old.
RHEL 6.9 has java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.131-2.6.9.0.el6_8 which was released on 2017-02-14. Between those two versions, there have been numerous bug fixes and several security updates.</p>

<p>Oracle release Java security updates on a quarterly basis and we at Red Hat apply those to our packages. Since taking over leadership of OpenJDK 7 after 7u80, we also create the backports for that version, using the patches from OpenJDK 8.</p>

<p>Upgrading to the newer version should be low risk, as each new build is testing against the Java 7 compatibility kit provided by Oracle. There is more of a risk in continuing to use a version which is prone to several known security exploits.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you raise a bug, one of the first things we're likely to ask you to do is try the latest version, and any fix for such a bug would go to the new version, not the unsupported 1.7.0_65.</p>

<p>There should also be a new release based on OpenJDK 7u141 coming in the next few weeks. That will contain a further collection of security updates and bug fixes.</p>

<p>The new metaclass will run an <code>_on_access</code> method, if it exists, whenever a member is accessed:</p>

<pre><code>class OnAccess(EnumMeta):

        if isinstance(obj, Enum) and obj._on_access:
            obj._on_access()
        return obj
</code></pre>

<p>The new base <code>Enum</code> treats any extra arguments on member creation as arguments for a <code>deprecate</code> function, and sets the <code>_on_access</code> attribute to that function only if extra arguments are given:</p>

<pre><code>class DeprecatedEnum(Enum, metaclass=OnAccess):
    #
    def __new__(cls, value, *args):
        member = object.__new__(cls)
        member._value_ = value
        member._args = args
        member._on_access = member.deprecate if args else None
        return member
    #
    def deprecate(self):
        args = (self.name, ) + self._args
        import warnings
        warnings.warn(
                ""member %r is deprecated; %s"" % args,
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=3,
                )
</code></pre>

<p>And our example <code>Enum</code> with deprecated members:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(DeprecatedEnum):
    BAR = ""bar""
    BAZ = ""baz"", ""use something else""
</code></pre>

<p>And the warnings (from a test script):</p>

<pre><code># no warning here
list(Foo)

# nor for non-deprecated members
Foo.BAR

# but direct use of deprecated members does generate warnings
Foo.BAZ
/home/ethan/test:74: DeprecationWarning: member 'BAZ' is deprecated; use something else
  Foo.BAZ

Foo('baz')
/home/ethan/test:75: DeprecationWarning: member 'BAZ' is deprecated; use something else
  Foo('baz')

Foo['BAZ']
/home/ethan/test:76: DeprecationWarning: member 'BAZ' is deprecated; use something else
  Foo['BAZ']
</code></pre>

<p>And all the deprecated members in <code>Foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print([m.name for m in Foo if m._args])
['BAZ']

<p>I have a tibble with two columns of parameters for different models, and I was hoping to find a way to generate a list column of lists of the first 80 outputs for those models. The sample here is of 100 models, but in the future, I'll be looking at over 10,000, which is why I'd like their outputs to be grouped with them in a row. </p>

<p><strong>What I've Tried</strong></p>

<pre><code>library(tidyverse)
new.tibble &lt;- tibble(a = rep(1:5, 20))
new.tibble &lt;- new.tibble %&gt;% add_column(b = 1:100)

my.vector &lt;- c(1:80)

# What I want
new.tibble &lt;- new.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = lapply(my.vector, function(x) {a ^ (x / b)}))
</code></pre>

<p>And I've tried this with the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family"">different apply functions</a> (sapply, lapply, apply, etc.), and it doesn't seem to work. When I run that last line, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; new.tibble &lt;- new.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = lapply(my.vector, function(x) {a ^ (x / b)}))
Error: Column `c` must be length 100 (the number of rows) or one, not 80
</code></pre>

<p>Which leads me to believe that the mutate is only generating 80 outputs in total, not 80 outputs per row and storing those 80 outputs in a list in that row as I'd like. I've tried having my tibble behave row-wise to see if that would help:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; row.tibble &lt;- rowwise(new.tibble)
&gt; row.tibble &lt;- row.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = lapply(my.vector, function(x){a ^ (x / b)}))
Error: Column `c` must be length 1 (the group size), not 80
</code></pre>

<p>And it did not. I know it would not be hard to set up a while loop and just have that generate the different outputs as their own separate lists, but with over 10,000 lists, each corresponding to a model in the rows, I'd like to think that a list-column would be the best way to organize the outputs. I've also tried using as.list to force a returned output of a list, but that didn't work as I intended:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; row.tibble &lt;- row.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = as.list(lapply(my.vector, FUN = function(x){a ^ (x / b)})))
Error: Column `c` must be length 1 (the group size), not 80
&gt; new.tibble &lt;- new.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = as.list(lapply(my.vector, FUN = function(x){a ^ (x / b)})))
Error: Column `c` must be length 100 (the number of rows) or one, not 80
</code></pre>

<p>I tried eschewing the lapply and trying to directly get my desired outputs, and that didn't work:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; new.tibble %&gt;% mutate(c = as.list(a ^ (my.vector / b)))
# A tibble: 100 x 3
       a     b c

<p>Or, the activity could just tell the fragment ""yo, your button was clicked"". Event buses are great for cases where there is no direct connection from the sender to the recipient (e.g., service to activity), or where the event may be of interest to several parties. In this case, using an event bus would seem to be unnecessary, since the activity already knows its fragments.</p>

<p>As I understand it this is because I have multiple libraries that depend on slf4j. The dependencies in my build.gradle file are:</p>

<pre><code>dependencies {
    compile project(':libraries:some-sdk')
    compile files('libs/some-library.jar')
    compile 'com.some-module:some-artifact:X.X.X'
    compile 'com.github.tony19:logback-android-classic:1.1.1-3'
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the logback-android-classic dependency is the problem because it does depend on slf4j and if I comment that out my project builds fine. According to other sources I've found this is usually solved by excluding the transitive dependency like so:</p>

<pre><code>compile('com.github.tony19:logback-android-classic:1.1.1-3') {
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j'
</code></pre>

<p>However even after I clean and rebuild I'm still getting the error.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Running dependencyInsight looking for slf4j as dmahapatro suggested returned no results:</p>

<pre><code>$ gradle -q dependencyInsight --dependency slf4j --configuration compile
No dependencies matching given input were found in configuration ':main:compile'

<p>Update 2:</p>

<p>I have narrowed the conflict down to the logback-android-classic library and a local jar (Unfortunately I can't edit this jar directly due to licensing issues). Excluding either of these resolves the conflict, and an empty generic test app with only these two dependencies will have the conflict. I have verified that the local jar contains org.slf4j but because of the aforementioned licensing issues, I can't do much about that. So I'm left with my only option being to exclude slf4j from logback-android-classic. Given that the dependency tree doesn't actually show slf4j as a dependency of logback-android-classic, and given that adding</p>

<pre><code>    compile('com.github.tony19:logback-android-classic:1.1.1-3') {
            exclude group: 'org.slf4j'
    }
</code></pre>

<p>has not resolved the issue, how can I exclude the slf4j dependency from logback-android-classic? </p>

<p>Final Update:
Ultimately this was resolved by working with the owners of the local jar I was using to get logback removed from that. I doubt that this is a particularly useful answer for future visitors, but wanted to include it for the sake of completion.</p>

<p>Our workflow looks something similar like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>dev1 creates change in baseline, exports patch via tortoiseHg</li>
<li>dev1 gives patch to dev2 for review</li>
<li>if review is ok, patch gets to a merge guy dev3, who then backports it</li>

<p>If there is a way to get the info via command line, that would work too, but adding the info to TortoiseHg would be better. Any ideas?</p>

"8305428","2011-11-29 03:22:22","3","","","","<p>In short: no, there is no way with that combo of Solr/SolrNet versions. SolrNet 0.3.1 implemented field collapsing for a nightly build of Solr, when it just started implementing field collapsing (it wasn't called 'grouping' then). After that, field collapsing was completely overhauled in Solr (now called 'result grouping'), and the SolrNet 0.3.1 implementation was left obsolete.</p>

<p>Support for result grouping was added shortly after that and released with 0.4.0a1. </p>

<p>I recommend going with 0.4.0a1. It's not 'unsafe' as in 'unstable' at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using nightly builds in production without any issues.</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/solrnet/downloads/list"" rel=""nofollow"">Download count</a> for 0.4.0a1 is pretty high, almost as much as 0.3.1</li>
<li>SolrNet is developed using <a href=""http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project36&amp;guest=1"" rel=""nofollow"">continuous integration and thoroughly tested</a>.</li>
<li>As I explained in the <a href=""http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/06/solrnet-040-alpha-1-released.html"" rel=""nofollow"">release notes</a>, 'alpha' to me means thoroughly unit-tested, but not API-frozen (API may slightly change in the GA release).</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing grouping client-side (i.e. LINQ) is not really an option, as you have to fetch <strong>all</strong> the documents to do so properly. It's just like wanting to to pagination + sorting client-side with a relational database.</p>

<p>You may also be able to backport result grouping to 0.3.1, but IMHO is really pointless and a waste  of time.</p>

<p>That's because loading the tuple from a constant is one operation, but the list would be 3 operations; load the two integer contents and build a new list object.</p>

<p>Because you are using a list literal that isn't otherwise reachable, it is substituted for a tuple:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(compile('number in [1, 2]', '&lt;stdin&gt;', 'eval'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (number)
              3 LOAD_CONST               2 ((1, 2))
              6 COMPARE_OP               6 (in)
              9 RETURN_VALUE        
</code></pre>

<p>Here the second bytecode loads a <code>(1, 2)</code> tuple as a constant, in <em>one</em> step. Compare this to creating a list object not used in a membership test:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(compile('[1, 2]', '&lt;stdin&gt;', 'eval'))
  1           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              3 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
              6 BUILD_LIST               2
              9 RETURN_VALUE        
</code></pre>

<p>Here N+1 steps are required for a list object of length N.</p>

<p>This substitution is a CPython-specific peephole optimisation; see the <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/66d6fa61ac38/Python/peephole.c#l84"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Python/peephole.c</code> source</a>. For <strong>other</strong> Python implementations then, you want to stick with immutable objects instead.</p>

<p>That said, the <em>best</em> option when using Python 3.2 and up, is to use a <em>set literal</em>:</p>

<pre><code>if number in {1, 2}:
</code></pre>

<p>as the peephole optimiser will replace that with a <code>frozenset()</code> object and membership tests against sets are O(1) constant operations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(compile('number in {1, 2}', '&lt;stdin&gt;', 'eval'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (number)
              3 LOAD_CONST               2 (frozenset({1, 2}))
              6 COMPARE_OP               6 (in)
              9 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>This optimization was added in <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#optimizations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python 3.2</a> but wasn't backported to Python 2.</p>

<p>As such, the Python 2 optimiser doesn't recognize this option and the cost of building either a <code>set</code> or <code>frozenset</code> from the contents is almost guaranteed to be more costly than using a tuple for the test.</p>

<p>Set membership tests are O(1) and fast; testing against a tuple is O(n) worst case. Although testing against a set has to calculate the hash (higher constant cost, cached for immutable types), the cost for testing against a tuple <em>other than the first element</em> is always going to be higher. So on average, sets are easily faster:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('1 in (1, 3, 5)', number=10**7)  # best-case for tuples
0.21154764899984002
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('8 in (1, 3, 5)', number=10**7)  # worst-case for tuples

<p>It's worth noting that <code>printf</code> will also overwrite the first character of the output array with <code>\0</code> in this context.</p>

<p>I am currently trying to retrofit a MUD codebase to support UTF-8, and unfortunately the code is riddled with cases where arbitrary <code>sprintf</code> precision is used to limit how much text is sent to output buffers. This problem is made much worse by the fact that most programmers don't <em>expect</em> a <code>-1</code> return in this context, which can result in uninitialized memory reads and badness that cascades down from that. (already caught a few cases in <em>valgrind</em>)</p>

<p>Has anyone come up with a concise workaround for this bug in their code that doesn't involve rewriting every single invocation of a formatting string with arbitrary length precision? I'm fine with truncated UTF-8 characters being written to my output buffer as it's fairly trivial to clean that up in my output processing prior to socket write, and it seems like overkill to invest this much effort in a problem that will eventually go away given a few more years.</p>

<p>Explanation.
I want to call subprocess with a timeout. For Python 3.3+ it is build in, but my application has be able to run using Python2.7 also. So I used <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/subprocess32/3.2.6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/subprocess32/3.2.6</a> as a backport.
To read the returned value I used  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24529110/how-to-retrieve-useful-result-from-subprocess"">How to retrieve useful result from subprocess?</a><br>
Without timeout, setting timeout to f.e. 1 sec the method works as expected. The result value and 'No time out' is printed.</p>

<p>I want to enforce a timeout so I set the timeout very short time 0.001 . So now only 'TimeoutExpired' should be printed. </p>

<p>I want to execute this is shell.
When if first comment out line #set_pdb_trace() 'TimeoutExpired' is printed, so expected behaviour.</p>

<p>Now I uncomment set_pdb_trace() and execute in shell.</p>

<p>The debugger displays, I press 'c' (continue) and 'No time out' with the result is printed. This result is different then without debug. The generate output is :</p>

<p>Does it? If not: You need to either create it (e.g. unzip a bundle at that location) or configure your build.<em>username</em>.properties - what's this? </p>

<p>Look at build.properties - you'll find many values configured in there. Just like with other property files in Liferay, you should identify the value that you want to change from the default, create a file named build.<em>username</em>.properties (replace with your actual username) and override the value that you'd like to change - e.g. <code>app.server.parent.dir</code> is a good candidate to point to your unzipped bundle.</p>

<p>Note that Java8 is not yet officially supported by Liferay: This is a portal that runs on so many existing application server that it's a bit slower in adopting new environments. That's not to say that it won't work - only if you run into Java8 related problems, you might want to try Java7, and be slow to adopt the new features so that you can easily backport. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily so. Take a look at the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/fragments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Fragments API</a>. It allows you to switch only parts of your UI. It was introduced in Android 3.0, but there exists an official backport of it, so that you can also use it in previous Android versions.</p>

<p>With it, you can put your buttons into the activity, the map in one fragment and the list in another, and then just switch the map with list while retaining the buttons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Service (or IntentService?) to retrieve the locations from the web.
  How should it let the Activity and ContentProvider know when new
  locations have been retrieved - via Broadcasts or should they bind to
  it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would strongly advice against this. You should use a service if you have long-lasting downloads in the background, like downloading a file or something. Short term JSON requests can and should be handled in the UI process. Use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html"" rel=""nofollow"">AsyncTask</a> or an <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Executor</a> for that. There has been advice by Google to put almost all of your requests into a service, but believe me, it's bull.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A ContentProvider, to cache and persist my locations. Perhaps the
  content provider should broadcast to the activities when new data is
  available to display?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not required. You only really need a ContentProvider if you plan to make your content accessible to other Applications or the System. For HTTP caching, you can directly access the database/filesystem, or better yet, use the <a href=""http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient-cache/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache HTTP Client Cache</a>. Works well if you use the already embedded Apache HTTP Client, which you should.</p>

<hr>

<p>Per the <a href=""http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/table3-9.html"">VT100 User Guide, Table 3-9: Special Graphics Characters</a>, when the “special graphics set” is selected, <code>x</code> is used to draw the “Vertical bar” and <code>q</code> is used to draw “Horizontal line - Scan 5”.</p>

<p>Under <em>terminfo</em>, the VT100 special graphics characters are available as a part of the Alternate Character Set functionality; see the “Line Graphics” section of the <a href=""http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=terminfo&amp;sektion=5""><em>terminfo(5)</em> man page</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Probably (on your Debian server) the effective <em>terminfo</em> database entry indicates that ACS is available, but your terminal emulator is not actually responding to the specified control sequences.</p>

<p>The <em>tmux</em> <a href=""http://tmux.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tmux/trunk/CHANGES?view=markup"">CHANGES</a> file indicates that some terminal emulators (e.g. Putty) do not respect the ACS control sequences when they are in UTF-8 mode. Thus, <em>tmux</em> 1.4 has a change that makes it always use UTF-8 characters instead of ACS sequences when the attaching client specifies that it can handle UTF-8 (i.e. when attaching, <code>-u</code> was given or <code>UTF-8</code> is present in LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG; the <code>utf8</code> window option is about what <em>tmux</em> should expect from the programs it runs, not what it can send to the attached client).</p>

<p><a href=""http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=tmux"">Debian “squeeze” only includes <em>tmux</em> 1.3</a>, so your <em>tmux</em> probably does not have the “prefer UTF-8 line drawing” feature (unless it pulls from a <a href=""http://backports-master.debian.org/"">backports</a> source).</p>

<p>If you can not fix your terminal emulator nor upgrade to at least <em>tmux</em> 1.4, then you might be able to use <em>tmux</em>’s <code>terminal-overrides</code> option to unset the ACS-related capabilities so that <em>tmux</em> will fall back to ASCII line drawing. In your <code>.tmux.conf</code> (on the Debian system):</p>

<p>The challenge is that these decorators are hard coded and that there is the potential for many iterations of the sofware. Interesting changes made on new projects are often backported to the older ones (which isn't terrible now with decorators since all that is required is adding another decorator to the definition). However, this still requires me to edit the subclass code. The optimal situation being the actual content creators choosing what features they need without requiring a programmer to edit anything. </p>

<p>Clearly, the better thing to do in this case is for the Book to use an object implementing the Builder pattern to create the Chapter object and wrap it in the correct decorators for the project.</p>

The order in which decorators are wrapped with imply an order for how interface calls are resolved (LIFO). An example is that the document edit tracking is implemented as a decorator but for obvious reasons should always evaluate first to save state before changes are made (it should be the last wrapper). For  future development assuming there will be many decorators, some which might need to resolve first should each decorator have something like a priority data member (integer?) which the Builder might sort on? It seems like a workable solution but I'm concerned that the implementation wouldn't be very robust if a large number of priority sensitive decorators/modules were created. Conflicting priorities might require renumbering many classes for example. Anyway, I would appreciate any thoughts people had on the matter.</p>

<p>The second issue is if two decorators change the same feature in some way. Should that situation even be possible? Should each decorator specify its domain and traverse the list of decorators looking for conflicts?</p>

<p>This is all assuming there will be many decorators and that some project editors will choose some but not others.
Thanks!</p>

There are lots of new goodies introduced in .NET 4.0 that weren't present in .NET 2.0.</p>

<p>Developers like working with the latest framework, so all new code is going to be implemented targeting that framework. The older version, targeting the older version of the framework, is provided for compatibility reasons only, as it likely provides only a minimally-necessary subset of features.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the newer framework provides performance or other improvements for the library code. Those can [sometimes] be backported to earlier versions of the framework, but they're often non-optimized implementations and should therefore be used only when absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>After some research, it looks like Apache's HttpClient does support <a href=""http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/caching.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">caching</a>, with the caveat that the default (in-memory) backend is probably not a good idea for memory-constrained Android apps.

<blockquote>
  <p>tap down, tap up, tap down, move</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems your interpretation of quick scale is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>tap down, tap up, tap down, tap up, tap down, move</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes your problem a lot easier if you only register a plain double tap on the second action down. When the second action up happens, you just need to figure out whether a drag has happened during the second tap cycle. In case the gesture recognizers don't work for you, you can do that manually by checking against <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewConfiguration.html#getScaledTouchSlop()"" rel=""nofollow"">getScaledTouchSlop</a>.</p>

<p>Also, copying the ScaleGestureDetector is probably not as bad as you think - github is littered with ""compat"" projects that are basically backports of features in newer SDK versions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python 3.0 adds several abstract base classes for numeric types inspired by Scheme’s numeric tower. These classes were backported to 2.6 as the numbers module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Python 3.0, the PEP slightly redefines the existing builtins round(), math.floor(), math.ceil(), and adds a new one, math.trunc(), that’s been backported to Python 2.6. math.trunc() rounds toward zero, returning the closest Integral that’s between the function’s argument and zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, thanks to @mark-dickinson comment, in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">what's new in python 2.7</a> page, the following text is found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The round() function is also now correctly rounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, the change happened in python 2.7. This can be verified checking that in python 2.6 the behaviour is still the old one:</p>

<pre><code>Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Aug 11 2011, 12:18:09)

&gt;&gt;&gt; round(f, 2)
1480.4000000000001
</code></pre>

<p>In my linux distribution I still have access to both python 2.6 and python 2.7 and probably you have also in yours; so, if you want the old behaviour, maybe you can try to run the code in python 2.6.</p>

       private Spinner spinner;

       public MainActivityInstrumentationTest() {

However; when I run the test the constructor throws an exception that fully qualified path to the .class is not found.  I've tried running <code>gradle</code> with <code>--debug</code> and I don't see anything out of the ordinary.  The apk file that is generated has a classes.dex and using <code>dex2jar</code> I see the MainActivity.class in there.  So at this point at a bit of a loss as to why the class file is not found during the test execution.  Does anyone have any other methods that I can try to debug this situation, like I said I have other projects that work just fine and I'm not able to modify them to exhibit this behavior.</p>

<p>A bdutil deployment will contain Snappy by default.</p>

<h1>For reference, the original answer:</h1>

<p>Your last question is the easiest to answer in the general case so I'll begin there. The general guidance for shipping dependencies is that applications should make use of the distributed cache to distribute JARs and libraries to workers (Hadoop 1 or 2). If your code is already making use of the GenericOptionsParser you can distrubte JARs with the -libjars flag. A longer discussion can be found on Cloudera's blog that also discusses fat JARs: <a href=""http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2011/01/how-to-include-third-party-libraries-in-your-map-reduce-job/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2011/01/how-to-include-third-party-libraries-in-your-map-reduce-job/</a></p>

<p>For installing and configuring other system-level components bdutil supports an extension mechanism. A good example of extensions is the Spark extension bundled with bdutil: extensions/spark/spark_env.sh. When running bdutil extensions are added with the -e flag e.g., to deploy Spark with Hadoop: </p>

<pre><code>./bdutil -e extensions/spark/spark_env.sh deploy

<p>With regard to your first and second questions: there are two obstacles when dealing with Snappy in Hadoop on GCE. The first is that the native support libraries built by Apache and bundled with Hadoop 2 tarballs are built for i386 while GCE instances are amd64. Hadoop 1 bundles binaries for both platforms, but snappy is not locatable without either bundling or modifying the environment. Because of this architecture difference, no native compressors are usable (snappy or otherwise) in Hadoop 2 and Snappy is not available easily in Hadoop 1. The second obstacle is that libsnappy itself is not installed by default. </p>

<p>The easiest way to overcome both of these is to create your own Hadoop tarball containing amd64 native Hadoop libraries as well as libsnappy. The steps below should help you do this and stage the resulting tarball for use by bdutil. </p>

<p>To start, launch a new GCE VM using a Debian Wheezy backports image and grant the VM service account read/write access to Cloud Storage. We'll use this as our build machine and we can safely discard it as soon as we're done building / storing the binary.</p>

<h2>Building Hadoop 1.2.1 with Snappy</h2>

<p>SSH to your new instance and run the following commands, checking for any errors along the way:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libsnappy-dev libz-dev libssl-dev gcc make cmake automake autoconf libtool g++ openjdk-7-jdk maven ant

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/

wget http://apache.mirrors.lucidnetworks.net/hadoop/common/hadoop-1.2.1/hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz

tar zxvf hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz 
pushd hadoop-1.2.1/

# Bundle libsnappy so we don't have to apt-get install it on each machine
cp /usr/lib/libsnappy* lib/native/Linux-amd64-64/

# Test to make certain Snappy is being loaded and is working:
bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop-test-1.2.1.jar testsequencefile -seed 0 -count 1000 -compressType RECORD xxx -codec org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec -check

# Create a new tarball of Hadoop 1.2.1:
popd
rm hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz
tar zcvf hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz hadoop-1.2.1/

# Store the tarball on GCS: 
gsutil cp hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz gs://&lt;some bucket&gt;/hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<h2>Building Hadoop 2.4.1 with Snappy</h2>

<p>SSH to your new instance and run the following commands, checking for any errors along the way:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libsnappy-dev libz-dev libssl-dev gcc make cmake automake autoconf libtool g++ openjdk-7-jdk maven ant

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/

<h2>Updating bdutil_env.sh or hadoop2_env.sh</h2>

<p>Once you have a Hadoop version with the correct native libraries bundled, we can point bdutil at the new Hadoop tarball by updating either bdutil_env.sh for Hadoop 1 or hadoop2_env.sh for Hadoop 2. In either case, open the approprirate file and look for a block along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code># URI of Hadoop tarball to be deployed. Must begin with gs:// or http(s)://
# Use 'gsutil ls gs://hadoop-dist/hadoop-*.tar.gz' to list Google supplied options
HADOOP_TARBALL_URI='gs://hadoop-dist/hadoop-1.2.1-bin.tar.gz'
</code></pre>

<p>and change the URI pointed to to be the URI where we stored the tarball above: e.g., </p>

<pre><code>HADOOP_TARBALL_URI='gs://&lt;some bucket&gt;/hadoop-1.2.1.tar.gz'

"8644205","2011-12-27 11:37:24","2","","","","<p>This could be fixed by <strong>upgrading</strong> your version of PostgreSQL, preferably to the current version 9.1. PostgreSQL 8.2 has been <a href=""http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Release_Support_Policy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">released in 2006 and reached end of life</a> recently.</p>
<p>There have been a large number of improvements for locales since then. As far as I can see, it works for me in version 9.0 (on Debian Squeeze):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT upper('ѓғг̡г̨һһ̨дђеёӗ');
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>ЃҒГ̡Г̨ҺҺ̨ДЂЕЁӖ
</code></pre>
<p>Note: I use <code>UTF8</code> as <code>server_encoding</code>, <code>UNICODE</code> as <code>client_encoding</code> and <code>*.UTF-8</code> (<code>de_AT.UTF-8</code> to be precise) for all locale settings (<code>lc_*</code>). Other encodings or locales may have specific problems. You might want to show us the output of this query:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM pg_settings WHERE name ~~ '%encod%' OR name ~~ 'lc%'
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Edit after feedback in comments:</h3>
<p>If &quot;nothing&quot; is set, that means the pseudo-locale <code>C</code> (aka <code>Posix</code>) is set. <code>C</code> is agnostic to any locale settings, which allows for faster sort operations. It also means that your system has no idea, what the upper case equivalent of a cyrillic letter is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the chapter <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/locale.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Locale Support</a> in the manual. (Links to version 8.2, <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/locale.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current version here</a>.)</p>
<p>However, <code>LC_CTYPE</code> can only be set at db cluster creation time. In newer versions you can base a new database off <code>template0</code> and specify different locale and encoding settings, but not in version 8.2.</p>
<p>So, I come back to my initial advise: best course of action would be to install a more recent version of PostgreSQL. And remember to set up your desired locale when setting up the new db cluster.</p>

  <p>If I try anything lower than 20 it says: library should not use a lower version then targetSdk version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is because you set your <code>targetSdkVersion</code> to something higher than 19. If you did so intentionally, fine. If you did not do so intentionally, consider dropping it back to <code>19</code> for now, and use <code>compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:19.1.0'</code> (if you are using the backport of fragments) or <code>compile 'com.android.support:support-v13:19.1.0'</code> (if you are not using the backport of fragments).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I use compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:20' I get: Failed to find: com.android.support:support-v4:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is because the Android Support package uses X.Y.Z semantic versioning, as do most artifacts in repositories. <code>20</code> does not match the X.Y.Z pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I use compile 'com.android.support:support-v7:20.0.+' I get: Avoid using + in version numbers, can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is merely a warning. If you are using version control for your project files, and you feel that it is important to be able to check out some earlier version of your code and be able to reproduce that build, then using the <code>+</code> notation is not a good idea. OTOH, if being able to reproduce historical builds is not essential, using the <code>+</code> wildcard, as you are doing, ensures that you get updates automatically. Having the <code>+</code> in the third position (Z in X.Y.Z) means that you will automatically get patchlevel updates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where can I find up-to-date, ready to use, version numbers that Do work? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little bit of a catch 22, introduced mainly by text search capabilities being considered ""experimental"" in earlier versions. Aside from being in an earlier development phase, the implementation is entirely different due to the fact that the ""whole"" query and index API has been re-written for MongoDB 2.6, largely in order to support the new types of indexes available and make the API for working with the data consistent.</p>

<p>So prior versions implement text search via the ""command"" interface directly and only. Things work a little differently and the current ""deprecation"" notice means that working in this way will be removed. But the <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.4/reference/command/text/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>""text""</strong></a> command will presently still operate as shown in the earlier documentation:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>db.data.runCommand(""text"", { ""search"": ""query"" })
</code></pre>

<p>So there are limitations here as covered in the existing documentation. Notably being that the number of documents returned are those contained the ""limit"" argument to that command and there is no concept of ""skip"". Also that this is a ""document"" response and not a cursor, so the total results cannot exceed the BSON limit of 16MB.</p>

<p>That said, a little off topic but consider your MongDB 2.6 deployment scenario, and mostly on the following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Future Proofing</strong>. In the earlier forms this is an experimental feature. So any general flaws and problems are not going to generally be ""backported"" in any way with fixes while you hang on to the version. Some may, but without a good reason to do so this mostly wanes over time. Remember this is ""experimental"" so due warning was given about use in production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency/Deprecation</strong>. The API for ""text"" and ""geospatial"" has changed. So implementation in earlier releases is different and ""deprecated"", and will go away. The right way is to have the same structure as other queries, and consistently use it in all query forms rather than a direct command.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment</strong>. You say you don't wan't to stop the server, but you really should not have one server anyway. Apart from being out of the general philosophy of why you need MongoDB anyway, at the very least a ""replica set"" is a good idea for data redundancy and the ""uptime"" of your application. Removing a single point of failure means that you can individually ""bring down"" discrete nodes and ""upgrade"" without affecting application downtime.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So that strays ""a little"" off the programming topic, but for me, the last point is the most important. Better to make sure your application is without the failure points by building this into your deployment architecture. This then makes ""staying ahead of the curve"" a simpler decision. It is always worth noting the ""experimental"" clause with technologies before rolling out to production. Cover your bases.</p>

"8726891","2012-01-04 12:29:41","4","","","","<p>Tcl applies “nohang”-like functionality to the whole channel, and it's done by configuring the channel to be non-blocking. After that, any <code>read</code> will return only the data that is there, <code>gets</code> will only return complete lines that are available without waiting, and <code>puts</code> (on a writable channel) will arrange for its output to be sent to the OS asynchronously. <em>This depends on the event loop being operational.</em></p>

<p>You are recommended to use non-blocking channels with a registered file event handler. You can combine that with non-blocking to implement your <code>coolget</code> idea:</p>

<pre><code>proc coolget {channel callback} {
    fileevent $channel readable [list apply {{ch cb} {
        if {[gets $ch line] &gt;= 0} {
            uplevel [lappend cb $line]
        } elseif {[eof $ch]} {
            # Remove handler at EOF: important!
            fileevent $ch readable {}
        }
    }} $channel $callback]
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will then work just fine, except that you've got to call either <code>vwait</code> or <code>update</code> to process events (unless you've got Tk in use too; Tk is special) as Tcl won't process things magically in the background; magical background processing causes more trouble than it's worth…</p>

<hr>

<p>If you're getting deeply tangled in asynchronous event handling, consider using Tcl 8.6's <a href=""http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/coroutine.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">coroutines</a> to restructure the code. In particular, code like <a href=""http://wiki.tcl.tk/22231"" rel=""nofollow"">Coronet</a> can help a lot. However, that is very strongly dependent on Tcl 8.6, as earlier Tcl implementations can't support coroutines at all; the low-level implementation had to be rewritten from simple C calls to continuations to enable those features, and that's not backport-able with reasonable effort.</p>

Save the extern.js file and then add it to your externs:    </p>

<pre><code>java -jar compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS \
  --js myjs.js --externs extern.js
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to just make all calls using string keys when accessing properties<br>
eg: <code>window[""sjcl""][""cipher""][""aes""]()</code></p>

<p>Closure Compiler 2012 version will be too old and missing externs for a lot of globals, which Closure Compiler advanced will need or it will treat them as mangleable properties (and subsequently as no-ops).<br>
Upgrading is recommended, because there have been a lot of improvements in the last 8 years, but this may not be practical due to large changes in how the code must be written (as your comment implies).  Below are some options for backporting externs and declaring your own.  If you have experience with TypeScript, the process of creating externs should feel familiar.</p>

<p>Here are some pre-built externs from Google that you should be able to use directly so you can use the crypto API (and other new APIs):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Repo location for updated global externs: <a href=""https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/externs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/externs</a></p></li>
<li><p>Repo location for WebCrypto API externs: <a href=""https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/externs/browser/w3c_webcrypto.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/externs/browser/w3c_webcrypto.js</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>For any library that you want to use (without bundling it and compiling it with your program) you will have to declare externs to prevent mangling:<br>
<a href=""https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3#externs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Declaring Externs Docs</a><br>
This is so that Closure Compiler knows that they are names of functions and objects that already exist and should not be mangled<br>
eg:</p>

<pre><code>// myexterns.js
function MyExternFunction(){};
window[""MyGlobalVariable""];
</code></pre>

<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>java -jar compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS \
  --js myjs.js --externs myexterns.js
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Trying to bundle libraries using Closure Compiler Advanced, especially the 2012 version, is most likely not going to be realistically possible unless they already target CC.  Just declare the externs and call it a day.</p>

<p>This doc explains the why you need externs and how the mangling effects your code:<br>

<p>Framework gives us three <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Transition.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Transition</code></a> types out of the box: <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Fade.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Fade</code></a>, <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Slide.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Slide</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Explode.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Explode</code></a>, but you can also create your custom type of transition extending <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Visibility.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Visibility</code></a> class and overriding appropriate methods.</p>

<p>So, having any <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ViewGroup</code></a>, we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>viewGroup.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(final View v) {
        Transition t = null;
        if (i == 1) {
            t = new Fade();
        } else if (i == 2) {
            t = new Slide(Gravity.BOTTOM);
        } else if (i == 3) {
            t = TransitionInflater.from(v.getContext())
                                  .inflateTransition(R.transition.my_transition);
        }

        Button button = new Button(v.getContext());
        button.setText(""My button "" + i++);

        TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition(customLayout, t);
        viewGroup.addView(button);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where <strong>my_transition.xml</strong> is following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;transitionSet xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
               android:duration=""3000""
               android:interpolator=""@android:interpolator/fast_out_slow_in""&gt;

    &lt;fade/&gt;
    &lt;slide android:slideEdge=""bottom""/&gt;

&lt;/transitionSet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We'll get this result:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OqhOm.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OqhOm.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Note, that we have to perform <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/TransitionManager.html#beginDelayedTransition(android.view.ViewGroup)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition()</code></a> before any change to layout has been made  (i.e. before <code>addView()</code> is called). Then framework will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>There is also another overload <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/TransitionManager.html#beginDelayedTransition(android.view.ViewGroup)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition(ViewGroup)</code></a>, where you do not need to specify what exact transition you want to be applied, and system will perform <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/AutoTransition.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>AutoTransition</code></a> animation, which basically will fade and change boundaries of animated view.</p>

<p>Framework's <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/TransitionManager.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>TransitionManager</code></a> is available from API 19, and fully supported from API 21 (by saying fully I mean e.g. <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Slide.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Slide</code></a> transition is available from API 21). Although there is <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/transition/package-summary.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">support package available</a>, but it doesn't backport all the functionality. Alternatively, you can move to <a href=""https://github.com/andkulikov/Transitions-Everywhere"" rel=""noreferrer"">TransitionsEverywhere</a> library, which backports everything up to Android 4.0.</p>

<p>Google declined the issue, but offered to help me in making the backport and library. So I'm trying to do that.</p>

<p>Also, HttpClient-Cache may be a neat thing to use. It doesn't work on Android as is, you need to make a small modification and recompile it.

<blockquote>
  <p>The rule of thumb is that fixes will be backported to the last major
  release for bugs that would have prevented a release in the first
  place (release blockers).</p>
  
  <p>Security fixes and data loss bugs will be applied to the current
  master, the last two major releases, and the current LTS release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since Django 1.7 is now got finally stable, current and new security problems would be fixed in 1.6, 1.7 and the latest <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#long-term-support-lts-releases""><code>LTS</code> release</a> 1.4. This is why 1.5 is considered ""insecure"".</p>

<p>There is no advantage to first creating a csv file, then zipping it, write the csv line directly to the outputstream. This can easily be done with java 1.6</p>

<p>The only limitation you might run into if it gets <strong>really</strong> big is that java 1.6 does not support zip64 and as such you are limited to 4gb. At some point I backported the zip functionality of 1.7 to 1.6 to resolve this issue.</p>

"25871717","2014-09-16 14:40:27","6","","","","<p>The method you suggest in your question will <em>not</em> do what you think. It will simply set the file to the <code>Encoding.default_internal</code> encoding, possibly after transcoding it from <code>Encoding.default_external</code>. These are both usually UTF-8.  The encoding is going to always be <code>Encoding.default_internal</code> after you run that code, it is <em>not</em> guessing or determining the encoding from the actual file. </p>

<p>If you have a file and you really don't know what encoding it is, you indeed will have to guess. There's no way to be 100% sure you've gotten it right as the author intended (and some files are corrupt and mixed encoding or not legal in any encoding). </p>

<p>There are libraries with heuristics meant to try and guess (they won't be right all the time). </p>

<p>Here's one, which I've never actually used myself, but the likelyist prospect I found in 10 minutes of googling: <a href=""https://github.com/oleander/rchardet"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/oleander/rchardet</a>  There might be other ruby gems for this. You could also use ruby system() to call a linux command line utility that tries to do this as well, someone above mentions the Linux <code>file</code> command. </p>

<p>If you don't want to load the entire file in to test it, you can certainly just load part of it in. Probably the chardet library will work more reliably the more it's got, but, sure, just read the first X bytes of the file in and then ask chardet to guess it's encoding. </p>

<pre><code> require 'chardet19'

 first1000bytes = File.read(file, 1000)
 cd = CharDet.detect(first1000bytes)
 cd.encoding
 cd.confidence
</code></pre>

<p>You can also always check to see if any string in ruby is valid for the encoding it's set at:</p>

<pre><code> str.valid_encoding?
</code></pre>

<p>So you could simply go through a variety of encodings and see if it's valid:</p>

<pre><code> orig_encoding = str.encoding

 str.force_encoding(""ISO-8859-1"").valid_encoding?
 str.force_encoding(""UTF-8"").valid_encoding?

 str.force_enocding(orig_encoding) # put it back to what it was
</code></pre>

<p>But it's certainly possible for a file to be valid in more than one encoding, or to be valid in a given encoding but read as nonsense by humans in that encoding. </p>

<p>If you have your best guess encoding, but it's still not <code>valid_encoding?</code> for that encoding, it may just have a few bad bytes in it.  You can remove them with <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-scrub"" rel=""noreferrer"">String.scrub</a> in ruby 2.1, or with this <a href=""https://github.com/jrochkind/scrub_rb"" rel=""noreferrer"">pure-ruby backport of String.scrub</a> in other ruby versions. </p>

I've implemented a <code>UISplitViewController</code> which is now natively supported on iPhone running iOS 8, and Xcode will automatically backport it for iOS 7. It's working really well, except when you launch the app on iPhone in portrait running iOS 8, the split view's detail view controller is displayed when I expected to first see the master view controller. I believed this was a bug with iOS 8 because when you run the app on iOS 7, it correctly shows the master view controller. But iOS 8 is now GM and this is still occurring. How can I set it up so that when the split view controller is going to be collapsed (only one view controller displayed on screen), when the split view controller is displayed it shows the master view controller not the detail?</p>

<p>I've created this split view controller in Interface Builder. The split view controller is the first view controller within a tab bar controller. Both the master and the detail VCs are navigation controllers with table view controllers embedded inside.</p>

    LocalTime start = LocalTime.parse(startTime, timeFormatter);

</code></pre>

<p>The output from this snippet is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TotalTime in Hours and Mins Format is 08:00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Tested on Java 1.7.0_67 with ThreeTen Backport.)</p>

<p>The datetime classes used in the other answers — <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>DateFormat</code> and <code>Calendar</code> — are all long outdated and poorly designed. Possibly worse, one answer is parsing and calculating “by hand”, without aid from any library classes. That is complicated and error-prone and never recommended. Instead I am using java.time, the modern Java date and time API. It is so much nicer to work with.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages: <code>org.threeten.bp.Duration</code>, <code>org.threeten.bp.LocalTime</code> and <code>org.threeten.bp.format.DateTimeFormatter</code>.</li>

<p>Here is the function which is in charge of creating these buttons.</p>

<p>When I run the project, I get the following error from the gradle build (I just show the most important lines of the stacktrace, and made a pastebin just because formatting is awful)</p>

<p>The stacktrace => <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/16888255/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paste.ubuntu.com/16888255/</a></p>

<pre><code>public void switchToCalendar(){

    execute(script);

}

public void switchToPlot(){
    String script = ""pManager.hotSwitch( aardex.plugin.ChronologyAdapter.prototype.type, pManager.plot.getScaleObj() );"";
    execute(script);

    getRootTab().openTab(RootTabPaneCtrl.TAB_PATIENT_CHRON_ID);
}

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>I finally gave up for these method references and reverted back to the state it was. As a precaution, I updated the JDK to 8u91, and know the error seems to affect another class which doesn't even has a method reference or a lambda expression ! The class is my Main class, and this is the <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/16920801/"" rel=""nofollow"">error</a> I'm getting (line 738).</p>

<p>What I understand is that <code>retrolambda</code> failed to backport my Main class because of a function <code>checkLicence(LicenceBusiness, String)</code>, which doesn't exist!</p>

<p>Please help, I'm really stuck and don't know what to do.</p>

"9100934","2012-02-01 18:08:37","1","","","","<p>You mean how you have the package listed twice? The basic answer is that <code>require</code> at one end of a relationship is the same as <code>before</code> at the other end of the relationship. That allows you to move the relationship specification onto the item that has to be inside the conditional:</p>

<pre><code>class nginx::package {
  case $operatingsystem {
    'debian': {
      apt::preference { 'nginx':
        package =&gt; 'nginx nginx-common',
        priority =&gt; '600',
        release =&gt; 'a=squeeze-backports',
        before =&gt; Package['nginx'];
      }
    }
    default: {} # nothing
  }
  package { 'nginx':
    ensure =&gt; present,
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Read the <a href=""http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/stable/metaparameter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">puppet metaparameter docs</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Another alternative with newer versions of puppet is to use <a href=""http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#chaining-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">chaining</a> like:</p>

<pre><code>class nginx::package {
  case $operatingsystem {
    'debian': {
      apt::preference { 'nginx': ...}
      Apt::Preference['nginx'] -&gt; Package['nginx']
    }
    default: {}
  }
  package { 'nginx': ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, there's a <code>Package['nginx'] { require =&gt; Apt::Preference['nginx'] }</code> syntax you can call to add a requirement to the Package, but I believe that requires you're doing it in an inherited class which would make things more complicated in your example and now that there's resource chaining available is more useful for things other than before/after/subscribe/notify changes to resources.</p>

<pre><code>class nginx::package::aptpreference inherits nginx::package {
  Package['nginx'] { require =&gt; Apt::Preference['nginx'] }
}
class nginx::package {
  case $operatingsystem {
    'debian': {
      apt::preference { 'nginx': ...}
      include nginx::package::aptpreference
    }
    default: {}

"82025","2008-09-17 11:04:26","4","","","","<p>Your original question seems to be asking for an iterator that sees live updates to the underlying collection while remaining thread-safe. This is an incredibly expensive problem to solve in the general case, which is why none of the standard collection classes do it.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways of achieving partial solutions to the problem, and in your application, one of those may be sufficient.</p>

<p>Jason gives <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75014/detecting-concurrent-modifications#75048"">a specific way to achieve thread safety, and to avoid throwing a ConcurrentModificationException</a>, but only at the expense of liveness.</p>

<p>Javamann mentions <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75014/detecting-concurrent-modifications#75196"">two specific classes</a> in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package that solve the same problem in a lock-free way, where scalability is critical. These only shipped with Java 5, but there have been various projects that backport the functionality of the package into earlier Java versions, including <a href=""http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>, though they won't have such good performance in earlier JREs.</p>

<p>If you are already using some of the Apache Commons libraries, then as jacekfoo <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75014/detecting-concurrent-modifications#75205"">points out</a>, the <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/collections/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apache collections framework</a> contains some helpful classes.</p>

"25899600","2014-09-17 20:17:58","42","","","","<p>No, there's no PEP.  There's an <a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue9337"" rel=""noreferrer"">issue</a> in the bug tracker, and an <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2010-July/102515.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">associated discussion</a> on the Python developers mailing list.  While I was responsible for proposing and implementing the change, I can't claim it was my idea: it had arisen during conversations with Guido at EuroPython 2010.</p>

<p>Some more details: as already mentioned in comments, Python 3.1 introduced a new algorithm for the string <code>repr</code> of a float, (later backported to the Python 2 series, so that it also appears in Python 2.7).  As a result of this new algorithm, a ""short"" decimal number typed in at the prompt has a correspondingly short representation.  This eliminated one of the existing reasons for the difference between <code>str</code> and <code>repr</code>, and made it possible to use the same algorithm for both <code>str</code> and <code>repr</code>.  So for Python 3.2, following the discussion linked to above, <code>str</code> and <code>repr</code> were made identical.  As to why: it makes the language a little bit smaller and cleaner, and it removes the rather arbitrary choice of 12 digits when outputting the string.  (The choice of 17 digits used for the <code>repr</code> in Python versions prior to 2.7 is far from arbitrary, by the way: two distinct IEEE 754 binary64 floats will have distinct representations when converted to decimal with 17 significant digits, and 17 is the smallest integer with this property.)</p>

<p>Apart from simplicity, there are some less obvious benefits.  One aspect of the <code>repr</code> versus <code>str</code> distinction that's been confusing for users in the past is the fact that <code>repr</code> automatically gets used in containers.  So for example in Python 2.7:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1.4 * 1.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
2.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [x]
[2.0999999999999996]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure there's at least one StackOverflow question asking about this phenomenon somewhere: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/7374836/270986"">here is one such</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/22429955/270986"">another</a> more recent one.  With the simplification introduced in Python 3.2, we get this instead:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1.4 * 1.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
2.0999999999999996
&gt;&gt;&gt; print([x])
[2.0999999999999996]
</code></pre>

<p>which is at least more consistent.</p>

<p>If you do want to be able to hide imprecisions, the right way to do it remains the same: use string formatting for precise control of the output format.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(""{:.12g}"".format(x))
2.1
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that explains some of the reasoning behind the change. I'm not going to argue that it's universally beneficial: as you point out, the old <code>str</code> had the convenient side-effect of hiding imprecisions.  But in my opinion (of course, I'm biased), it does help eliminate a few surprises from the language.</p>

Why are you putting the team in place?<br>
Are you trying to unify all the applications, develop a common framework, what?<br>
What is the mandate and the vision for this team?</p>

<p>Whoever the lead on this team better have kick a** interpersonal skills.<br>
It should <strong>not</strong> be the brilliant coder that can whistle the star wars theme song and make light saber noises... but he should probably be on the team in a technical capacity.</p>

<p>You should probably populate the team with people that are familiar with the majority of the projects. I would be wary of selecting <em>all</em> the current leads, as that might take a big chunk of knowledge from the current teams.  And let's face it, those teams have to be productive while the architecture team comes up with its own deliverables.</p>

(You can find examples like this all over the tutorial, the reference docs, and the stdlib implementation.)</p>

<p>However, I can see what you're thinking: the dict is in some sense a container of key-value pairs (even if it's only a <code>collections.Container</code> of keys…), so… shouldn't there be some way to just check whether a key-value pair exists?</p>

<p>Up to Python 2.6, there really isn't.* But in 3.0, the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items"" rel=""nofollow""><code>items()</code></a> method returns a special <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict-views"" rel=""nofollow""><code>set</code>-like view</a> of the key-value pairs. And 2.7 backported that functionality, under the name <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.viewitems"" rel=""nofollow""><code>viewitems</code></a>. So:</p>

<pre><code>('key1', 'val1') in d.viewitems()
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think that's really clearer or cleaner; ""items"" feels like a lower-level way to think of dictionaries than ""mappings"", which is what both your original code and smci's answer rely on.</p>

<p>It's also less concise, it doesn't work in 2.6 or earlier, and many <code>dict</code>-like mapping objects don't support it,** and it's and slightly slower on 2.7 to boot, but these are probably less important, and not what you asked about.</p>

<p><sub>* Well, there <em>is</em>, but only by iterating over all of the items with <code>iteritems</code>, or using <code>items</code> to effectively do the same exhaustive search behind your back, neither of which is what you want.</sub> </p>

<p>No, those are not related. OpenGLExtension is compiled after QtGui.</p>

<p>We had used something like this in our project a couple of years ago when we were writing thread-safe singletons based on QtCore:</p>

#define __MEMBARRIER MemoryBarrier();   
#else   
#define __MEMBARRIER

<p>Qt may need to check ifdef MINGW/GCC/VERSION and undef the MemoryBarrier define.</p>

"56481983","2019-06-06 16:53:24","1","","","","<h2>java.time and ThreeTenABP</h2>

<p>java.time, the modern Java date and time API, gives a pretty natural way to control the time zone. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    ZoneId zone = ZoneId.of(""Asia/Istanbul"");
    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""M/d/uuuu&amp;HH:mm"");
    String timeStamp = ZonedDateTime.now(zone).format(formatter );
    System.out.println(timeStamp);
</code></pre>

<p>When I ran this snippet just now, the output was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6/6/2019&amp;19:53</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what your time zone is and trust you to specify the correct one. It matters.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use java.time on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, java.time works nicely on older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On (older) Android use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. And make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What went wrong in your code?</h2>

<p>As others have said, your issue is a time zone issue. Apparently your <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> had its time zone set to UTC. When you’re not specifying time zone, it picks up its time zone from the JVM, which in turn <em>usually</em> picks it up from the operating system if not specified otherwise. That your JVM is using UTC is a standard practice, so not that much of a surprise.</p>

<p>Anyway, the datetime classes you were using, <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and <code>Calendar</code>, are poorly designed, the former in particular notoriously troublesome. Fortunately both are long outdated. Instead use java.time, the modern Java date and time API.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've just noticed that the phone hour is 3 hours backwards as well. Is
  there a way to change it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most likely the phone system clock is correct (maybe even updated automatically from a time server), but its time zone is set to UTC. There should be a way to set it to your time zone in the phone settings (then it will likely also be used by your JVM).</p>

<h2>ISO 8601</h2>

<p>As an aside your timestamp format is peculiar. I recommend that you use a standard format, best ISO 8601, and also that you include offset in the string so that even if the time zone was wrong, the time would still be unambiguous and correct. Two examples. First you may use UTC consciously:</p>

<pre><code>    String timeStamp = Instant.now().toString();
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>2019-06-06T16:57:19.493599Z</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trailing <code>Z</code> means UTC.</p>

<p>If you want your own time zone:</p>

<pre><code>    String timeStamp = OffsetDateTime.now(zone).toString();
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>2019-06-06T19:58:29.788376+03:00</p>

The packages I need (android.hardware.usb or android.future.usb) are completely absent from earlier API levels, but I need the app to run on at least Android 2.2. Right now, it won't even install (I get ""INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY"" in Eclipse).</p>

<p>I've done some research and come up with the following potential solutions, but I need help choosing which one is the ""best"" (easiest to implement, cleanest, easiest to maintain, most logical...) or if there's another solution I've overlooked.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solution #1:</strong> Create two branches of the project: one supporting accessories, and one for older phones.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Keeps things clean, and I could just designate one project as the phones-only one, and the other as tablets-only.</p>

<p><strong>Con:</strong> Requires that I set up a Library project or work up some kind of custom build script so I don't have to duplicate all of my code across two projects.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solution #2:</strong> Use reflection to manually load the necessary classes at runtime, and throw an exception if the class does not exist.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong> I can maintain backwards compatibility without having to make multiple projects.</p>

<p><strong>Con:</strong> It seems a little messy/hacky</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So in a nutshell...</strong> how can I use a package that only exists in API level 12 and up, but still have the app run on earlier versions?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>No, there is no reason why you shouldn’t want to use java.time, the modern Java date and time API if you’re on Java 8 or later (where it’s built in).</p>

<p>The only thing one may briefly consider, is the one you have already excluded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am writing a new project, which does not need to be backwards compatible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even for backward compatibility you can safely use java.time since conversion methods are built into the old classes from Java 8.</p>

<h2>Java 6 and 7: weigh</h2>

<p>If you’re on Java 6 or 7, you will need to use the <a href=""https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>ThreeTen-Backport</em></a> for java.time, further adapted for Android below API level 26 in <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>ThreeTenABP</em></a>. If you’re doing only very little very simple date and time work and forward compatibility somehow isn’t an issue, you may consider whether the external dependency is worth it. Please take into account that your external dependency is but a backport of what is built into Java 8 and later, so rock solid, and therefore furthermore that you will only need it until you migrate to Java 8 or later. At which time you can change your imports, retest and do away with the backport.</p>

<h2>Your examples of thinkable liabilities</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current EE libraries X and Y don't work correctly with LocalDate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are some examples of that, also library classes in the JDK. My choice would be to use java.time in my own code and only convert just before calling into the API that doesn’t yet accept a java.time type. And conversely if I get an instance of an outdated class from the API, convert it first thing and use java.time for the rest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This very useful pattern is broken with LocalTime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know of no such pattern. On the contrary java.time uses patterns <em>immutable objects</em> and <em>factory method</em>, in contrast to most of the old classes.</p>

It seems like most of the techniques for <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Cocoa64BitGuide/64BitChangesCocoa/chapter_3_section_2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004247-CH4-DontLinkElementID_1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">preparing for the move to 64 bit</a> (NSInteger, etc) are only available in 10.5+, and it would not be possible to use these if writing for 10.4.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The downside would of course be that we'd no longer be supporting an operating system that was only a year out of date.</p>

<p>My boss is himself supportive of this move, but of course has our customers to consider and doesn't want to cause any more issues for them than are justified. The director of support would like to support 10.4. I suspect the other execs will be marginally against it at first, just due to the not being able to support some customers thing. Everybody would be open to persuasion by a good argument from either side.</p>

<p>I'm trying to talk to some of the support people and get an idea of how many of our customers are actually still using 10.4, but I don't have that data yet.</p>

<p>Some kind of hybrid solution might be possible, such as rewriting parts of the old client to use the new webservice, or writing the client in 10.5 and backporting it to 10.4 if enough people made a fuss, but quite frankly those sound like they're likely to be even more trouble than giving up the 10.5 features and writing the code in 10.4 to begin with.</p>

<p>So I guess my questions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given the information above, do you think making a case for the adoption of 10.5+ only is the right thing to do? Do you have any suggestions as to how this might be presented positively to the rest of the company?</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know as much about the coming 64 bit transition as I'd like. Does anybody have any good references on what will be different, and do you think that supporting only 10.5+ would make this transition easier for us?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know what your product is, or who your customers are, but from my experience, Mac users are early adopters (relatively speaking) I've never used an OS X version longer than two weeks before the next upgrade was out, and in my circle I am a late adopter. Ofcourse I'm not just a business Mac user and that may well make a big difference.</p>

<p>What makes 64bits a requirement in your code? There's not much of a reason to not compile a universal binary holding as many architectures as you wish you could have one binary run on G4, G5, IA32 and IA64 no problem, and have it be native on all of them. If you're just doing 64bits because you can there's no reason (that I can imagine) not to keep supporting 32bits, but if you want stuff like CoreAnimation you don't have much choice.</p>

<p>I don't think it's wrong to demand 10.5 for new development, but it wouldn't make much business sense to force a whole new OS on customers just to keep using your existing product. So if you can, stay compatible, maybe backport your new features/patches for a time. There is a good reason for forking in version control and this might be it.</p>

<p>edit-</p>

<p>Since I posted this I learned that I was wrong and NSInteger did not exist before 10.5. I think I assumed too much having used similar types (like NSDecimal) earlier.</p>

<p>You may want to use lower case <code>xx</code> so you also get <code>+0000</code> rather than

<p>Thanks, Ole V.V. for the value addition which will benefit someone looking for <code>+0000</code> rather than <code>Z</code> for a zero-timezone offset. I recommend using this strictly based on the specific requirement. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> recommends using <code>Z</code> as the timezone designator for a zero-timezone offset.</p>

<p>Just 11 and above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I am writing an app for API level 8, should I care about an element that was deprecated in API level 11?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Deprecated"" in Android usually means ""we think that there is a better solution that you should consider, but we will support this old approach as best we can as long as we can"". While you should endeavor to stop using deprecated methods, that's not something you should panic about and drop everything to address right away, and often times you <em>need</em> the deprecated materials for older Android OS levels, before they were deprecated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does that mean it does nothing for all API levels below also or just API level 16 and above?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since they said ""now does nothing"", it is safe to say that it did something (non-nothing?) previously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if you are working on professional, commercial software, how important is it to avoid deprecated elements?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the specific case of this method, I'd skip using it, though that's more due to the nature of this method.</p>

<p>As a counter-example, the way preference screens are set up differs substantially in API Level 11+ (<code>PreferenceFragment</code> and <code>PreferenceActivity</code>) versus before (<code>PreferenceActivity</code> alone). You can't avoid the deprecated element on older devices, simply because there is no viable alternative (e.g., backport of <code>PreferenceFragment</code>).</p>

<p>To get around this problem, you'll have to create an Enum with your choices and manage it outside of you model. If you're using Python 2, use the backport module enum34. To get Enum.choices to return strings, subclass Enum like so:</p>

<pre><code>class ChoiceEnum(Enum):
    @classmethod
    def choices(cls):
        # get all members of the class
        members = inspect.getmembers(cls, lambda m: not (inspect.isroutine(m)))
        # filter down to just properties
        props = [m for m in members if not (m[0][:2] == '__')]
        # format into django choice tuple
        choices = tuple([(str(p[1].value), p[0]) for p in props])
        return choices
</code></pre>

<p>Then, rather than specifying the choices at the model level, use a custom field in your ModelForm.</p>

<pre><code>usertype = forms.TypedChoiceField(choices=MyEnum.choices(), coerce=str)

<p>Use a backport, like <a href=""http://actionbarsherlock.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ActionBarSherlock</a>, which offers action bars back to API Level 7. More importantly, it does so using an API compatible with the official action bar implementation, and so dropping ActionBarSherlock in a year or two (when you drop support for API Level 9-10) will be fairly easy. And, your app will have a consistent look and feel with other Android apps.</p>

<p>For a more general solution, replace <code>.parseDefaulting(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH, date.getDayOfMonth())</code> with <code>.parseDefaulting(ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH, 1)</code> which will also simplify the solution by removing the need to obtain the <code>LocalDate</code> first.</p>

<h2>Original answer:</h2>
<p>The legacy date-time API (<code>java.util</code> date-time types and their formatting API, <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>) is outdated and error-prone.

<p><strong>Solution using the modern API:</strong></p>
<p>Your date-time string does not have day-of-month. It means that you need to provide a day-of-month to the <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> which you can do by using <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatterBuilder.html#parseDefaulting-java.time.temporal.TemporalField-long-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>DateTimeFormatterBuilder#parseDefaulting</code></a>. In order to obtain the first <em>Monday</em> of the month, the idiomatic way is to use <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/TemporalAdjusters.html#firstInMonth-java.time.DayOfWeek-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TemporalAdjusters.firstInMonth</code></a>.</p>

<p>I'm trying to run apt-get on Ubuntu virtual box, but I keep getting connection and time-out errors.  I'm not sure what is causing them because the proxies are set.  Here is my system:</p>

<h2>System config</h2>

<pre><code>HOST: Win 7 Enterprise, SP1 (64-bit OS)
RAM: 8 GB
CPU: Intel i5 2.6GHz
VirtualBox 4.2.12
Ubuntu 64 (ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso)
</code></pre>

<h2>Steps to reproduce issue</h2>

<p>Here is the workflow and the error that it produces:</p>

<p>1) SSH to the Ubuntu VM from GitBash (or any other *nix command line).  Note: The <code>&lt;localhost_alias&gt;</code> has already been configured in the hosts file.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;ftp_port&gt; &lt;localhost_alias&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) Set your proxies.  I simply copy-pasted these from a text file onto the command line and hit enter to process the last one also.</p>

<pre><code>export http_proxy=http://proxy.somecorpdom:8080/
export https_proxy=https://proxy.somecorpdom:8080/
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.somecorpdom
</code></pre>

<p>3) Run apt-get update.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<h2>Results and errors</h2>

<p>After running the update command, the following immediately displays, but hangs for several minutes:</p>

<pre><code>0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.91.15)] [Connecting to security.ubuntu.com (91.189.92.202)]
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually the former message goes away and I get this (un-abridged):</p>

The test database is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'] = 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
DATABASES['default']['NAME'] = ':memory:'
DATABASES['default']['OPTIONS'] = {}
DATABASES['default']['TEST_NAME'] = ':memory:'

<p>I put a a print statement in <code>django.db.backends.creation.create_test_db</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    # We need to then do a flush to ensure that any data installed by
    # custom SQL has been removed. The only test data should come from
    # test fixtures, or autogenerated from post_syncdb triggers.
    # This has the side effect of loading initial data (which was
    # intentionally skipped in the syncdb).
    call_command('flush',
        verbosity=max(verbosity - 1, 0),
        interactive=False,
        database=self.connection.alias)

    print 'django_site' in self.connection.introspection.table_names()

<p>Which prints out:</p>

<pre><code>True

<p>So we see our database has been set up correctly.  However on the first request, a context_processor tries to access the Site model:</p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
Site.objects.get(pk=1)
DatabaseError: Database...o_site',)
</code></pre>

<p>And listing all the tables, returns an empty list:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import connection
print connection.introspection.table_names()

<hr>

<pre><code>[]

<ul>
<li>The <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/31848934/10819573"">accepted answer</a> works as a result of mere coincidence. It happened to work just because the values are arranged in the decreasing order of time units (year, month, day, hour, minute, second). It will fail if their positions are changed e.g. <code>MMyyyy...</code>. Another serious problem with this approach is that it will fail to validate a wrong value e.g. 15 digits instead of 14 digits.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/31849176/10819573"">This</a> has similar problems as with the accepted answer. Instead of numeric value, it compares ASCII values and thus may fail for the same reasons as mentioned for the accepted answer.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/31849098/10819573"">This</a> is the idiomatic way of doing it, but it is wrong because it uses <code>Y</code> (which specifies <em>week-based-year</em>) instead of <code>y</code> (which specifies <em>year-of-era</em>) and <code>D</code> (which specifies <em>day-of-year</em>) instead of <code>d</code> (which specifies <em>day-of-month</em>). In fact, it is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/65928023/10819573"">recommended</a> to use <code>u</code> instead of <code>y</code>.

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/31849038/10819573"">This</a> is blatantly wrong. <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html#Date-long-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Date(long date)</code></a> should initialize the object with the no. of milliseconds since <code>1970-01-01T00:00:00Z</code>.</li>

<p>Sorry for earlier mis-report that it was working in Java 1.7.0_21 (I had made a setup error with java version switching in my IDE).  </p>

<p><strong>Fixed in Java 8</strong></p>

"17014817","2013-06-09 22:33:23","19","","","","<p>From <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2"">unittest2 website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unittest2 is a backport of the new features added to the unittest
  testing framework in Python 2.7. It is tested to run on Python 2.4 -
  2.7.</p>
  
  <p>To use unittest2 instead of unittest simply replace import unittest
  with import unittest2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its a bit confusing as from a version 2 is not expected to be a backport, but a new major release with (probably) new features. Anyway, the main idea is creating a backport where all the user has to do is changing the import statement. For this they could not change their method signatures</p>

<p>Also, from <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html"">unittest website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Python unit testing framework, sometimes referred to as “PyUnit,”
  is a Python language version of JUnit, by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.
  JUnit is, in turn, a Java version of Kent’s Smalltalk testing
  framework. Each is the de facto standard unit testing framework for
  its respective language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this explains the whole resemblance between the frameworks and <em>probably</em> the camel case notation</p>

<p>I recommend you use the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern date-time API</a><sup>*</sup>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">available symbols</a>, the closest match can be obtained with the pattern, <code>EEE dd MMM uuuu HH:mm:ss OOOO (zzzz)</code>. However, it will display a <code>:</code> as the separator in the timezone offset. If you want the exact format, you can use the pattern, <code>EEE dd MMM uuuu HH:mm:ss 'GMT'XX (zzzz)</code> in which <code>GMT</code> has been used as a <code>String</code> literal.</p>
<p><strong>Demo:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.Month;
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.time.ZonedDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ZonedDateTime zdt = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate.of(2015, Month.MAY, 29), LocalTime.of(10, 22, 30),
                ZoneId.of(&quot;America/New_York&quot;));

        DateTimeFormatter dtf1 = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;EEE dd MMM uuuu HH:mm:ss OOOO (zzzz)&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
        String formatted1 = dtf1.format(zdt);
        System.out.println(formatted1);

        DateTimeFormatter dtf2 = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;EEE dd MMM uuuu HH:mm:ss 'GMT'XX (zzzz)&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
        String formatted2 = dtf2.format(zdt);
        System.out.println(formatted2);
    }

My samples are split into case and controls and I would like to know the genes that are up or down regulated in case samples (i.e. those with the condition) versus controls. However, I am having an issue where currently genes' results are related to the control samples rather than case when using <code>edgeR</code>. I can reproduce the issue in R with fake data.</p>
<p>The fake data has lower count values in control than case samples so we would expect all genes to be up-regulated in case samples:</p>
<pre><code>#First create the expression matrix
set.seed(101)
#create data so first 50 (the controls) have lower values than second 50 samples (those with the condition)
exprDat &lt;- cbind(matrix(round((runif(500)/10)*100),ncol=50),
                    matrix(round((1-runif(500)/10)*100),ncol=50))
colnames(exprDat) &lt;- paste0(&quot;sample_&quot;,1:100)
rownames(exprDat) &lt;- paste0(&quot;gene_&quot;,1:10)

#Now create the annotation dataset
targets &lt;- data.frame(&quot;group_sample&quot;=colnames(exprDat),
                      &quot;case_control&quot;=as.factor(c(rep(&quot;Control&quot;,50),

#create the design matrix comparing case and control
design &lt;- model.matrix(~case_control, data = targets)
y &lt;- edgeR::DGEList(counts = exprDat,
                    group = targets[[&quot;case_control&quot;]])
#normalise
y &lt;- edgeR::calcNormFactors(y,method = 'TMM')
y &lt;- edgeR::estimateDisp(y, design)
#build linear model
fit &lt;- edgeR::glmFit(y, design = design)
#test the comparison, coef=1 is the intercept
test &lt;- edgeR::glmLRT(fit,coef=2)
pvals &lt;- test$table
</code></pre>
<p>My issue with the above is that the logFC all relate to the control samples rather than the case. We can see this in the design firstly since the column is <code>case_controlControl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(design)
  (Intercept) case_controlControl
1           1                   1
2           1                   1
3           1                   1
4           1                   1

6           1                   1

<p>At first I thought this was not a problem since I could just change the factor ordering in <code>targets</code> so the design matrix would create a <code>case_controlCase</code> which would thus be the opposite comparison, meaning the p-values would be the same but the direction of the logFC would be flipped:</p>
<pre><code>#reorder levels in target
levels(targets$case_control) &lt;- sort(levels(targets$case_control),
                                        decreasing=TRUE)
design &lt;- model.matrix(~case_control, data = targets)
y &lt;- edgeR::DGEList(counts = exprDat,
                    group = targets[[&quot;case_control&quot;]])
y &lt;- edgeR::calcNormFactors(y,method = 'TMM')
y &lt;- edgeR::estimateDisp(y, design)
fit &lt;- edgeR::glmFit(y, design = design)
test &lt;- edgeR::glmLRT(fit,coef=2)
pvals &lt;- test$table
</code></pre>
<p>The design matrix updates as expected:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(design)
  (Intercept) case_controlCase
1           1                1
2           1                1
3           1                1
4           1                1
5           1                1
6           1                1
</code></pre>
<p>However, weirdly the genes are still related to controls:</p>

<p>I have no clue why this is still happening since <code>design</code> has changed! If anyone has any clue that would be amazing as this has been wrecking my head for a while! Alternatively, if anyone has a different way to flip the logFC so it relates to the case samples rather than controls (i.e. ensure that control samples are taken as the intercept in the GLM), it would be great. Just to note, I know I could just swap the sign in the resulting table but this is something I really want to avoid and would much rather understand what is going wrong in my code above.</p>
<p>Finally, just to state, I think my issue is not specific to <code>edgeR</code> but just a general question for differential analysis using a GLM. Fundamentally, I just want to know how to swap the intercept coefficient using a GLM and design matrix. For clarity, I have also posted this to Biostars, a specific biological analysis community site: <a href=""https://www.biostars.org/p/9469339/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.biostars.org/p/9469339/</a></p>

<p>This gives:</p>

<pre><code>Fri Feb 23 16:50:15 CET 2018
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the other answers are already giving <code>java.time</code> as the first way to fix your problem. I just wanted to elaborate a little bit on why and how.</p>

<ul>
<li>The classes <code>Date</code> and <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> are long outdated. Because it was realized that they were poorly designed, their replacement came out in <code>java.time</code> with Java 8 in 2014. This modern API is so much nicer to work with.</li>
<li><code>SimpleDateFormat</code> in particular is notoriously troublesome.</li>
<li>The old-fashioned classes (with the exception of <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code>) only support millisecond procision, so there is no way they could parse or just hold the full precision of your timestamps with 7 decimals on the seconds.</li>
<li>Your string is in ISO 8601 format. The modern classes parse and print this format as their default, that is, without any explicit formatter. And importantly, they have no problems in parsing anything from 0 to 9 decimals on the seconds correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What went wrong in your code</h2>

<p>API 19 (in agreement with the docs!) parses the number after the decimal point as 9643834 milliseoncds, that is, 2 hours 40 minutes 43 seconds 834 milliseconds. I was actually surprised to learn from your questions and from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/48952369/5772882"">laalto’s answer in particular</a> that this inadequate behaviour has been fixed in later Android versions. In my Java 9 it still rules.</p>

<h2>Question: Can I use <code>java.time</code> on Android?</h2>

<p>Yes, <code>java.time</code> works nicely on Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on new Android devices (from API level 26, I’m told) the new API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the new classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310, where the modern API was first described).</li>
<li>On (older) Android, use the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. Make sure you import the date and time classes from package <code>org.threeten.bp</code> and subpackages.</li>

<p>I am not sure if this is a good way to estimate the complexity of short strings, because to correctly compute the Kolmogorov (K-) complexity of a string we have to factor in the length of the program used to decompress the string. The length of the program (67k for xz 5.1.0 on my Debian laptop) will overwhelm short strings. Thus, the following program is closer to computing a K-complexity upper bound:</p>

<pre><code>import lzma #For python 2.7 use backports.lzma

program_length = 67000

def lzma_compression_ratio(test_string):
    bytes_in = bytes(test_string,'utf-8')
    bytes_out = lzma.compress(bytes_in)
    lbi = len(bytes_in)
    lbo = len(bytes_out)+program_length
    ratio = lbo/lbi
    message = '%d bytes compressed to %d bytes, ratio %0.3f'%(lbi,lbo,ratio)
    print(message)
    return ratio

test_string = 'a man, a plan, a canal: panama'
lzma_compression_ratio(test_string)

for n in range(22,25):
    test_string = 'a'*(2**n)
    lzma_compression_ratio(test_string)
</code></pre>

<p>The output below shows that the compression ratio is over 2000 for a string of 30 a's, and falls below 0.01 for repeating strings of length 2^23. These are technically correct upper bounds on K-complexity, but clearly not useful for the short string. The program ""print('a'*30)"" has length 13, which gives a K-complexity upper bound of 0.43 (13/30) for the string 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'.</p>

<pre><code>30 bytes compressed to 67024 bytes, ratio 2234.133
4194304 bytes compressed to 67395 bytes, ratio 0.016
8388608 bytes compressed to 68005 bytes, ratio 0.008
16777216 bytes compressed to 69225 bytes, ratio 0.004
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Original answer</strong>:</p>

<p>@Superbest, this seems to work, but I don't know if it's the most efficient:</p>

<pre><code>import lzma

def lzma_compression_ratio(test_string):
    c = lzma.LZMACompressor()
    bytes_in = bytes(test_string,'utf-8')
    bytes_out = c.compress(bytes_in)
    return len(bytes_out)/len(bytes_in)

test_string = 'a man, a plan, a canal: panama'
compression_ratio = lzma_compression_ratio(test_string)

<blockquote>
<p>This can often be useful to basically trick Git into thinking that a branch is already merged when doing a merge later on.  For example, say you branched off a <code>release</code> branch and have done some work on it that you will want to merge back into your <code>master</code> branch at some point.  In the meantime some bugfix on <code>master</code> needs to be backported into your <code>release</code> branch.  You can merge the bugfix branch into the <code>release</code> branch and also <code>merge -s ours</code> the same branch into your <code>master</code> branch (even though the fix is already there) so when you later merge the <code>release</code> branch again, there are no conflicts from the bugfix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph makes no sense to me.  (Keep in mind I’ve never used Git—I’m reading the book as a very first introduction.)</p>
<p>First of all, it’s talking about merging the bugfix into both the <code>release</code> branch and the <code>master</code> branch, but it had said that the bugfix was “on” <code>master</code>—which I would take to mean it was in commits done directly to <code>master</code>.  This seems to be self-contradictory as to whether there is even a separate bugfix branch or not.</p>
<p>Maybe “on” <code>master</code> here means that it’s already been merged into <code>master</code>, but then this seems to imply that we’re trying to fake merge the same bugfix branch into <code>master</code> that we already actually merged before.  This would seem to be reinforced by the assertion that “the fix is already there”.  But what could possibly be the point of merging the same branch, unchanged, into <code>master</code> twice?  Why wasn’t the first time enough to solve the supposed problem?</p>
<p>Furthermore, regardless of how the bugfix got into <code>master</code>, <em>why would it generate a conflict when merging from</em> <code>release</code><em>?</em>  The fix should be the same lines of code on both sides of the merge, so intuitively, I would expect this merge to succeed without conflict here, without resorting to any trickery.</p>
<p>I’m almost wondering if the book meant to say that a bugfix in <code>release</code> was to be backported into <code>master</code>.  I’d read this to mean that the bugfix is cherry-picked into <code>master</code>.  Even in this scenario, I still don’t understand, though, why the fake merge would be needed, since again, the bugfix lines should match between both sides of the eventual merge of <code>release</code> into <code>master</code>, so shouldn’t produce a conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m not even clear on how a fake merge would solve a merge conflict, anyway.  As best as I can tell, a fake merge would change neither the common ancestor of, nor the content on either side of, the eventual problem merge, and as such should not change its outcome at all.</p>
<p>Can someone explain more clearly, perhaps with a diagram, what the book is trying to get at here?  Or if I’m misunderstanding something, point out what that something is?</p>

<a href=""http://sphinxsearch.com/wiki/doku.php?id=charset_tables"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://sphinxsearch.com/wiki/doku.php?id=charset_tables</a>
does have a Devanagari list might be usable?</p>
<p>Manticore Search (mentioned in the comment) does have more elaborate charset_tables by default. Its default 'non_cjk' should support Hindi. Can either just use it in Manticore , or could (with a bit of effort) backport it and use it in Sphinx.

<p>The modern date-time API offers <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>OffsetDateTime</code></a> to represent a date-time object with a timezone offset. It can be converted to <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Instant</code></a> which represents an instantaneous point on the timeline. An <code>Instant</code> is independent of any timezone i.e. it has a timezone offset of <code>+00:00</code> hours, designated as <code>Z</code> in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> standards.</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html#toEpochMilli--"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Instant#toEpochMilli</code></a> converts this instant to the number of milliseconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. This value can be set into an object of <code>GregorianCalendar</code> which will then represent the same moment.</p>

<p>Calling <code>getTime()</code> on the <code>GregorianCalendar</code> converts to a <code>Date</code> (another old and error-prone class) which doesn’t have a time zone, so the offset is lost. Printing the time zone ID and the hour of day demonstrates that both offset and time of day are preserved in the <code>GregorianCalendar</code>.</p>

Switch to the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern</a> <code>java.time</code> date-time API and the corresponding formatting API (<code>java.time.format</code>).

<p>Use <code>DateTimeFormatter.RFC_1123_DATE_TIME</code>; it works for both of your strings. It’s really the same format, only with the offset from UTC (or GMT) denoted differently. <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> is part of java.time, the modern Java date and time API. I recommend that you prefer java.time over <code>Date</code> and <code>DateUtils</code>, also because the <code>Date</code> class is poorly designed and long outdated.</p>
<pre><code>    String s = &quot;Thu, 20 Aug 2020 13:30:16 +0000&quot;;
    OffsetDateTime dt = OffsetDateTime.parse(s, DateTimeFormatter.RFC_1123_DATE_TIME);
    System.out.println(dt);

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>
<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On older Android either use desugaring or the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. In the latter case make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

Types if import:
* top-level: imported at the top-level - look at these first
* conditional: imported within an if-statement
* delayed: imported from within a function
* optional: imported within a try-except-statement

IMPORTANT: Do NOT post this list to the issue-tracker. Use it as a basis for
           yourself tracking down the missing module. Thanks!

<p>Its strange because the I have build container before but never encountered the error. I saw online for answers they say adjust you system clock. I am using Windows laptop and I checked date-time is correct.
Any idea what can cause this error ?</p>

<p>If it is valid according to which standard is this valid and what is
the UTC time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have asked <strong>three questions</strong> in this line and the answer to these questions are as follows:</p>
<h1>Is it valid?</h1>
<p>Yes, it is a valid date string.</p>
<p>You have already mentioned in your question that it does not have a time part; rather, it has a (timezone) offset of <code>+02:00</code> hours. So, it is just a valid date string, not a date-time string.</p>
<h1>Which standard is this?</h1>
<p>This is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a>.</p>
<h1>What is the UTC time?</h1>
<p>A date starts with the start-of-the-day time which, in most cases, is <code>00:00</code> hours. However, for the timezones that observe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DST</a>, it may not be the case. Such timezones have generally one hour difference in the timezone offset between with and without DST.</p>
<p>Your string has a fixed (timezone) offset (<code>+02:00</code>); rather than a timezone itself (e.g. <code>Africa/Cairo</code>) and therefore, in this case, the start of the day is always <code>00:00</code> hours.</p>
<p>So, it can be written as <code>2014-06-10'T'00:00:00+02:00</code>. As soon as you represent it in this way, I am sure you must have already guessed that it is equivalent to <code>2014-06-09'T'22:00:00Z</code> where <code>Z</code> is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">timezone designator</a> for zero-timezone offset. It stands for Zulu and specifies the <code>Etc/UTC</code> timezone (which has the timezone offset of <code>+00:00</code> hours).</p>

However, there is the <strong>linux compat</strong> projects.  See the <a href=""https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backports wiki</a>.  Basically, there are libraries that provide <em>shim</em> functionality for newer Linux ABI's which you can use to link your code.  The <code>KERNEL_VERSION</code> macro that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/689077/eugene"">Eugene</a> notes is inspected in a <em>compat.h</em>, and appropriate <em>compat-2.6.38.h</em>, etc are included where each version has either macros and/or library functions to provide a <em>forward</em> API.</p>

<p>This lets the Linux Wifi group write code for the <em>bleeding</em> edge kernel, while still making it possible to compile on older kernel versions.</p>

<p>I guess this answers the question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if there are any standard ways to deal with versioning?</p>

<p>The <em>compat</em> library is not a panacea, but at least it is there and under development.</p>

"27049132","2014-11-20 20:40:03","3","","","","<p>This is explained in <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#multithreading"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older SQLite versions had issues with sharing connections between threads. That’s why the Python module disallows sharing connections and cursors between threads. If you still try to do so, you will get an exception at runtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>This is actually configurable at build time, but most people don't configure and build their Python and stdlib from scratch. However, notice that the docs link to the page for <a href=""https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite"" rel=""nofollow""><code>pysqlite</code></a>, pointing out that ""<code>sqlite3</code> is developed externally under the name <code>pysqlite</code>."" And you can build and install <code>pysqlite</code>, and use that in place of the stdlib module, if you really need free-threading.</p>

<hr>

<p>In fact, IIRC, as of somewhere around <code>pysqlite</code> 2.5/Python 3.4, <code>sqlite3</code>, 
there's a not-quite-undocumented feature that allows you to disable the thread-safety checks by passing <code>check_same_thread=False</code> to the <code>Connection</code> constructor (and any <code>Cursor</code> objects you create will then inherit it from the <code>Connection</code>). If you do that, then you can safely share the objects between threads—but you still can't use them in parallel, only within a mutex, because concurrency hasn't been fully tested yet (which is also why it's a not-quite-undocumented feature instead of a documented feature).</p>

<hr>

<p>The portable approach, of course, is to not share connections and cursors between threads, as the docs say.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have each <code>WorkerThread</code> (or even each task, if they're part of a thread pool) create its own <code>Connection</code>. The performance cost of opening a bunch of connections isn't that high. However, make sure you read the <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q5"" rel=""nofollow"">SQLite FAQ</a> on concurrent access and thread safety. In practice, if you want to be fully portable (including database files that may be on network shared drives, old versions of SQLite, etc.), you will want to create a shared <code>threading.Lock</code> and have your threads acquire that lock around each access to the database (including their initial <code>Connection</code> constructor).</p>

<p>Another way to do it is to run all your SQLite queries on a single thread, and have your other threads just submit a query and get back a future they can block on. If you can require either Python 3.2+, or the PyPI backport (which works back to 2.6, IIRC), <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>concurrent.futures</code></a> is the easiest way to do this. If not, you can build futures and a single-thread executor yourself pretty easily out of, e.g., a thread, a queue, and a condition per future.</p>

<p>I've personally used the futures solution a few times. It may seem like you're throwing away a lot of parallelism, but you're actually not; if you use a connection from multiple threads, it uses its own mutexes and also requires you to add mutexes on top of it; if you use multiple connections, it uses file locks, which are even heavier. If the single-thread executor isn't giving you enough concurrency, getting rid of it probably won't either, and you'll need to use MySQL or something similar instead of SQLite.</p>

"48977796","2018-02-25 19:55:26","13","","","","<p>That's a very subjective question, and probably not a good fit for StackOverflow so imagine this will get closed. But here's my two cents...</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I primarily use Apache.</p>
<p>For a start let's address one of your incorrect points: Nginx wasn't designed to solve HTTP/1 problems. Nginx was designed to solve some of the scalability problems of previous web servers by being based on an asynchronous, event-driven model. Under HTTP/2 there should be less connections per client, which you could argue makes scalability less of an issue as each client uses only 1/6th of the resources they did previously - but that's probably a little simplistic. <a href=""https://serverfault.com/questions/383526/how-do-i-select-which-apache-mpm-to-use"">Apache has an event-driven MPM module</a> for years now too (though often not turned on by default in case of any thread unsafe PHP applications - but this would also be a problem with Nginx!). This brings them more back in line, though there's still a lot of debate about this and many say Nginx is still faster. In my experience, unless you are dealing with truly huge volumes (in which case you should be looking at CDNs, load-balancers and cache accelerators), few will ever notice the difference between Nginx and Apache. This is especially true when downstream applications and systems come into play - <a href=""http://www.speedemy.com/apache-vs-nginx-2015/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a slow PHP application will quickly negate any performance or scalability issues at the web server level</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to your main question:</p>
<p>For HTTP/2 support, my choice would be Apache over Nginx. It has had better HTTP/2 support for some time. <a href=""https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-9-http2-server-push/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nginx only added HTTP/2 Push support in early 2018</a> for example, whereas Apache has had that for a number of years now. Apache also supports a <a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html#h2pushdiarysize"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PushDiary</a> (based on the now-abandon <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-digest-02"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cache-Digests</a> proposal) to prevent pushing resources that have already been sent, supports <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8297"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">103 Early Hints</a> for pushing early, and <a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html#h2pushpriority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">push prioritisation options</a>. Moving on from HTTP/2 push, Apache also supports using <a href=""https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_http2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTP/2 in proxy mode</a> (though it's still marked as experimental and <a href=""https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/154"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the usefulness of this is questionable at the moment</a>), and HTTP/2 over HTTP (h2c - though again usefulness is questionable since browsers do not support this). I also find the main developer of the Apache HTTP/2 implementation very responsive on the <a href=""https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub page for the mod_http2 module</a> (included as part of core Apache since 2.4.18 and no longer marked as &quot;experimental&quot; since 2.4.26).</p>
<p>On the flip side, I understand that Cloudflare uses a customised Nginx based web server, and they have HTTP/2 push for over a year now (it was them that backported this implementation to Nginx). So, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/03/cloudflare-turns-on-http2-for-all-of-its-users/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">given Cloudflare's scale</a>, that speaks volumes to the implementation of that <a href=""https://blog.cloudflare.com/end-of-the-road-for-cloudflare-nginx/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">though not sure how customised it is from the core Nginx code</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href=""https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTP/2 conformance Testing tool available</a> and when I ran this against some common HTTP/2 servers (for a <a href=""https://www.manning.com/books/http2-in-action?a_aid=tunetheweb&amp;a_bid=a810f9b6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">book I wrote on the subject</a> btw) I got the following results which clearly shows Apache as the most compliant with the spec:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ic3F8m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ic3F8m.jpg"" alt=""Which is the most compliant HTTP/2 server?"" /></a></p>
<p>Now to be fair, most of the causes of errors are in not responding correctly to bad requests, that in a perfect world should never be sent anyway so aren’t that important. But still, we don’t live in a perfect world, and error checking is an important part of technology so I for one would certainly prefer the more compliant server. Similarly as pointed out in the comments below, the tool and web servers themselves, can be subject to race conditions and other problems which may incorrectly report errors.</p>
<p>Ultimately you are best choosing the implementation you are most comfortable with. The general feel has always been that Nginx is lighter and easier to configure, but on the flip side perhaps isn't as fully featured as Apache because of that. HTTP/2 support seems to continue that theme. If you want to play with upcoming HTTP/2 features then, to me, Apache definitely has the edge at the moment (though nothing to say that won't change in the future). However, for the basic use cases of HTTP/2, they probably can be considered similar. Even HTTP/2 Push is not used much yet, and there are serious concerns <a href=""https://jakearchibald.com/2017/h2-push-tougher-than-i-thought/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it could degrade performance if not used appropriately or due to implementation issues</a>, which is probably why it has not been a priority for Nginx and while they only implemented it later.</p>

I already see the <code>print</code> statements causing problems, so at the top just add <code>from __future__ import print_statement</code>. This will cause Python 2.7 to read <code>print</code> as if it were running in 3.x. Running the code through trial and error, backporting features as needed might be the best way to accomplish your goal. I will be happy to help with any further problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch a program in the background.</li>
<li>Send it input, as if it came from a user on the console.</li>
<li>Read its output that it tries to display to a user on the console.</li>
<li>At the same time, run another thread that does other stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is pretty easy; in fact, you've mostly written it, you just need to add a <code>thread1.start()</code> somewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>subprocess</code></a> module lets you launch a program and control its input and output. It's easiest if you want to just feed in all the input at once, wait until it's done, then process all the output, but obviously that's not your case here, so it's a bit more involved:</p>

<pre><code>minecraft = subprocess.Popen(['java', 'path/to/minecraft_server.jar', '-other', 'args],

<p>I'm merging stdout and stderr together into one pipe; if you want to read them separately, or send stderr to /dev/null, or whatever, see the docs; it's all pretty simple. While we're making assumptions here, I'm going to assume that <code>minecraft_server</code> uses a simple line-based protocol, where every command, every response, and every info message is exactly one line (that is, under 1K of text ending in a <code>\n</code>).</p>

<p>Now, to send it input, you just do this:</p>

<pre><code>minecraft.stdin.write('Make me a sandwich\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in Python 3.x:</p>

<pre><code>minecraft.stdin.write(b'Make me a sandwich\n')
</code></pre>

<p>To read its output, you do this:</p>

<pre><code>response = minecraft.stdout.readline()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>That works just like a regular file. But note that it works like a <em>binary</em> file. In Python 2.x, the only difference is that newlines don't get automatically converted, but in Python 3.x, it means you can only write <code>bytes</code> (and compatible objects), not <code>str</code>s, and you will receive <code>bytes</code> back. There are good reasons for that, but if you want to get pipes that act like text files instead, see the <code>universal_newlines</code> (and possibly <code>bufsize</code>) arguments under <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments"" rel=""nofollow"">Frequently Used Arguments</a> and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Popen</code> Constructor</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, it works like a <em>blocking</em> file. With a regular file, this rarely matters, but with a pipe, it's quite possible that there will be data later, but there isn't data yet (because the server hasn't written it yet). So, if there is no output yet (or not a complete line's worth, since I used <code>readline()</code>), your thread just blocks, waiting until there is.</p>

<p>If you don't want that, you probably want to create another thread to service stdout. And its function can actually look pretty similar to what you've got:</p>

<pre><code>def listener():
    for line in minecraft.stdout:
        if line.strip() == ""Server can't keep up!"":
            minecraft.stdin.write(""Restart Universe\n"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now that thread can block all day and there's no problem, because your other threads are still going.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, not quite <em>no</em> problem. </p>

<p>First it's going to be hard to cleanly shut down your program. </p>

<p>More seriously, the pipes between processes have a fixed size; if you don't service stdout fast enough, or the child doesn't service stdin fast enough, the pipe can block. And, the way I've written things, if the stdin pipe blocks, we'll be blocked forever in that <code>stdin.write</code> and won't get to the next read off <code>stdout</code>, so that can block too, and suddenly we're both waiting on each other forever.</p>

<p>You can solve this by having another thread to service stdout. The <code>subprocess</code> module itself includes an example, in the <a href=""https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/subprocess.py#l1175"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Popen._communicate</code></a> function used by all the higher-level functions. (Make sure to look at Python 3.3 or later, because earlier versions had bugs.)</p>

<p>If you're in Python 3.4+ (or 3.3 with a backport off PyPI), you can instead use <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio.create_subprocess_exec"" rel=""nofollow""><code>asyncio</code></a> to rewrite your program around an event loop and handle the input and output the same way you'd write a reactor-based network server. That's what all the cool kids are doing in 2017, but back in late 2014 many people still thought it looked new and scary.</p>

<hr>

<p>If all of this is sounding like a lot more work than you signed on for, you may want to consider using <a href=""https://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>pexpect</code></a>, which wraps up a lot of the tedious details, and makes some simplifying assumptions that are probably true in your case.</p>

<p>As I am new to Docker build and docker compose I strongly believe that it is something to do with image building process. If anyone of you have come across similar issue and resolved it kindly provide me suggestions to solve above one.</p>

"63559318","2020-08-24 10:33:26","2","","","","<p>It looks like there is some gap in your understanding of Zone-Offset in the date-time string. The date-time string <code>2020-08-24T11:50:18.613+0300</code> means it is the date-time at the Zone-Offset of <code>+0300 hours</code> i.e. the corresponding date-time string on <code>UTC</code> will be <code>2020-08-24T8:50:18.613+0000</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>java.util.Date</code> lacks time-zone and zone-offset information. It just has the number of milliseconds since the epoch of 1 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. When you print a <code>java.util.Date</code> using an instance of <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>, you print the string representing the date-time in the time-zone set into the instance of <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>. You can understand it from the following example:</p>
<pre><code>import java.text.DateFormat;
import java.text.ParseException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.TimeZone;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {
        // Parse the date-time string to java.util.Date
        String serverDate = &quot;2020-08-24T11:50:18.613+0300&quot;;
        final String SYSTEM_FORMAT = &quot;yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ&quot;;
        DateFormat dfSource = new SimpleDateFormat(SYSTEM_FORMAT);
        Date date = dfSource.parse(serverDate);
        System.out.println(date);

        // Get the date-time string for the time-zone of Europe/Moscow from
        // java.util.Date
        Locale locale = new Locale(&quot;ru&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;);
        DateFormat dfTarget = new SimpleDateFormat(SYSTEM_FORMAT, locale);
        dfTarget.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;Europe/Moscow&quot;));
        System.out.println(dfTarget.format(date));
    }
}

An <code>int</code> holding the value 7 can be presented as (formatted into) 7, 07, 007 or +7 while still just holding the same value without any formatting information — the formatting lies outside the <code>int</code>. Just the same, a <code>Date</code> holds a point in time, it can be presented as (formatted into) “June 1st 2017, 12:46:01.169”, “2017/06/01” or “1 Jun 2017” while still just holding the same value without any formatting information — the formatting lies outside the <code>Date</code>.</p>

<p>Depending on your requirements, one option is you store your date as a <code>Date</code> (or better, an instance of one of the modern date and time classes like <code>LocalDate</code>) and keep a formatter around so you can format it every time you need to show it to the user. If this won’t work and you need to <em>store</em> the date in a specific format, then store it as a <code>String</code>.</p>

<h2>Java 8 (7, 6) date and time API</h2>

<p>Now I have been ranting about using the newer Java date and time classes in the comments, so it might be unfair not to show you that they work. The question tries to format as <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code>, which we may do with the following piece of code.</p>

<pre><code>    DateTimeFormatter dateFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""uuuu/MM/dd"");
    for (LocalDate date : localDates) {
        String formatterDate = date.format(dateFormatter);
        System.out.println(formatterDate);
    }

<p>In one run I got</p>

<pre><code>2017/05/23
2017/06/01
</code></pre>

<p>Should your objects in the list have other types than <code>LocalDate</code>, most other newer date and time types can be formatted in exactly the same way using the same <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>. <code>Instant</code> is a little special in this respect because it doesn’t contain a date, but you may do for example <code>myInstant.atZone(ZoneId.of(""Europe/Oslo"")).format(dateFormatter)</code> to obtain the date it was/will be in Oslo’s time zone at that instant.</p>

<p>The modern classes were introduced in Java 8 and are enhanced a bit in Java 9. They have been backported to Java 6 and 7 in the <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen Backport</a> with a special edition for Android, <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a>.

"63564726","2020-08-24 16:09:05","2","","","","<p>I'm guessing you're going to have a &quot;bad time&quot; with this project. Prior to the 2016 release, backwards compatibility wasn't a <em>thing</em> with SSIS projects. Even now, it's still hit or miss because of custom components, version dependencies, etc.</p>
<p>The differences in 2012-2019 packages is incremental whereas the jump between 2008 and 2012 can be the width of the ocean. 2012 introduced the Project Deployment Model which your screenshot indicates your source uses that development and deployment model. Which was a godsend as we could package up project parameters, connection managers, parameters etc into a single deployable quantum called the .ispac Those concepts did not exist in the 2008 release so going backwards is generally not doable as you might have concepts in the new that don't exist in the old (as well as tasks like Expression Task or just the binaries of the Script Task/Components that won't move well)</p>
<p>Now that I've laid out all the pain points you're going to experience, let's talk about getting that package out of the SSISDB. This is a multi-hop problem. It sounds like you don't have the original project <code>AgencySales</code> that created it. No problem - open a current version of Visual Studio that has SQL Server Data Tools installed and Add a New Project  and under the Integration Services specific section (not the default Business Intelligence section), choose Integration Services Import Project Wizard. This will pull the entire project from the SSISDB and turn it into a complete SSIS project.</p>
<p>Select Integration Services Catalog and fill out the server and folder/project path <code>AgencySales</code> After you click through everything, you have a complete version of your project.</p>
<p>Now comes the hard part - backporting work. If it's a trivial package - one data flow task in the control flow and that being a Source to Sink type of data processing, you'll be better off just rewriting for 2008.</p>
<p>If it's something more complex than that, then you're going to need a lot more work and maybe it's better to continue hunting down all the nooks and crannies the previous developer took. I would not use that approach and instead, I'd use <a href=""https://bimlscript.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Biml</a> Biml is a meta language that describes business intelligence objects - in this case, an SSIS package. Install the free add-on <a href=""https://varigence.com/bimlexpress"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BimlExpress</a> to your existing Visual Studio instance. Now you can right click on the package and select &quot;Convert SSIS packages to Biml&quot; When that completes, a BimlScript.biml file will be in the Miscellaneous folder.</p>
<p>Biml is Biml is Biml. It describes the SSIS elements as they are -&gt; this is an &quot;Execute SQL Task.&quot; How it's physically implemented in an SSIS package is quite version dependent so the Biml Engine takes care of translating <code>ExecuteSQL</code> into version specific package XML. Very cool concept that I've been working with for 7? years now.</p>
<p>Now, you're in a bit of a pickle as I don't remember whether Visual Studio 2010 was the bridge solution for 2012 packages or whether it was just the spruced up interface for 2008. If it targeted 2008, then grab the BimlExpress version that specifies &quot;Download for Visual Studio 2010&quot; Install that and in your &quot;Integration Services Project 2&quot; you should have a right click menu available at the Project level that says &quot;Add new Biml File&quot;. Do that. In the empty BimlScript.biml that opens up, copy the contents from the VS2012+ version of BimlScript.biml into the empty file. Save. Right click on BimlScript.biml and choose Generate SSIS Package.</p>
<p>The paid-for product, <a href=""https://varigence.com/BimlStudio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BimlStudio</a> greatly simplifies this rigmarole as you import the project into it and simply change the selector to emit  2008/R2 specific packages.</p>

"63566467","2020-08-24 18:12:43","2","","","","<p>There’s no need to worry about offset from UTC or time zone when comparing times. Comparison across offsets goes smoothly.</p>
<h2>java.time</h2>
<p>I am using java.time, the modern Java date and time API. Let’s first define a couple of useful constants:</p>
<pre><code>private static final Duration TOLERANCE = Duration.ofHours(1);

private static final DateTimeFormatter serverFormatter = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()
        .append(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME)
        .appendPattern(&quot;XX&quot;)
        .toFormatter();
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can do:</p>
<pre><code>    String serverDateTimeString = &quot;2020-08-24T11:50:18.613+0300&quot;;
    OffsetDateTime serverTime = OffsetDateTime.parse(serverDateTimeString, serverFormatter);
    System.out.println(&quot;Server time: &quot; + serverTime);
    
    ZoneId deviceTimeZone = ZoneId.of(&quot;Asia/Yekaterinburg&quot;);
    OffsetDateTime deviceTime = OffsetDateTime.now(deviceTimeZone);
    System.out.println(&quot;Device time: &quot; + deviceTime);
    
    if (deviceTime.isBefore(serverTime.minus(TOLERANCE)) || deviceTime.isAfter(serverTime.plus(TOLERANCE))) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Difference between time on server and Android device system time more than 1 hour&quot;);
    } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Difference between time on server and Android device system time 1 hour or less&quot;);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>I have used your string from the question, so we shouldn’t be surprised that the snippet tells us there’s a great difference between the two times when I run it now:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Server time: 2020-08-24T11:50:18.613+03:00
Device time: 2020-08-24T23:08:57.939565+05:00
Difference between time on server and Android device system time more than 1 hour
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of the experiment let’s also try setting the device time to the time from your question:</p>
<pre><code>    OffsetDateTime deviceTime = OffsetDateTime.of(2020, 8, 24, 13, 50, 18, 0, ZoneOffset.ofHours(5));
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Server time: 2020-08-24T11:50:18.613+03:00
Device time: 2020-08-24T13:50:18+05:00
Difference between time on server and Android device system time 1 hour or less
</code></pre>

<h2>Question: Doesn’t java.time require Android API level 26?</h2>
<p>java.time works nicely on both older and newer Android devices. It just requires at least <strong>Java 6</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java 8 and later and on newer Android devices (from API level 26) the modern API comes built-in.</li>
<li>In non-Android Java 6 and 7 get the ThreeTen Backport, the backport of the modern classes (ThreeTen for JSR 310; see the links at the bottom).</li>
<li>On older Android either use desugaring or the Android edition of ThreeTen Backport. It’s called ThreeTenABP. In the latter case make sure you import the date and time classes from <code>org.threeten.bp</code> with subpackages.</li>

<p>Sample:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class RULES(object):

"17203525","2013-06-20 00:31:16","5","","","","<p>There are 2 ways to do things simultaneously. Or, really, 2-3/4 or so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple threads
<ul>
<li>Or multiple processes, especially if the ""things"" take a lot of CPU power</li>
<li>Or coroutines or greenlets, especially if there are thousands of ""things""</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Event loops (either coded manually)
<ul>
<li>Or hybrid greenlet/event loop systems like <code>gevent</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>If you have 1000 URLs, you probably don't want to do 1000 requests at the same time. For example, web browsers typically only do something like 8 requests at a time. A pool is a nice way to do only 8 things at a time, so let's do that.</p>

<p>And, since you're only doing 8 things at a time, and those things are primarily I/O bound, threads are perfect.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll implement it with <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/concurrent.futures.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>futures</code></a>. (If you're using Python 2.x, or 3.0-3.1, you will need to install the backport, <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures"" rel=""nofollow""><code>futures</code></a>.)</p>

<pre><code>import concurrent.futures

urls = ['http://example.com/foo', 
        'http://example.com/bar']

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    result = b''.join(executor.map(download, urls))

with open('output_file', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(result)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Of course you need to write the <code>download</code> function, but that's exactly the same function you'd write if you were doing these one at a time.</p>

<p>For example, using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/urllib.request.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>urlopen</code></a> (if you're using Python 2.x, use <code>urllib2</code> instead of <code>urllib.request</code>):</p>

<pre><code>def download(url):
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as f:
        return f.read()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you want to learn how to build a thread pool executor yourself, <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.3/Lib/concurrent/futures/thread.py"" rel=""nofollow"">the source</a> is actually pretty simple, and <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.3/Lib/multiprocessing/pool.py"" rel=""nofollow""><code>multiprocessing.pool</code></a> is another nice example in the stdlib.</p>

<p>However, both of those have a lot of excess code (handling weak references to improve memory usage, shutting down cleanly, offering different ways of waiting on the results, propagating exceptions properly, etc.) that may get in your way.</p>

<p>If you look around PyPI and ActiveState, you will find simpler designs like <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/threadpool"" rel=""nofollow""><code>threadpool</code></a> that you may find easier to understand.</p>

<p>But here's the simplest joinable threadpool:</p>

<pre><code>class ThreadPool(object):
    def __init__(self, max_workers):
        self.queue = queue.Queue()
        self.workers = [threading.Thread(target=self._worker) for _ in range(max_workers)]
    def start(self):
        for worker in self.workers:
            worker.start()
    def stop(self):
        for _ in range(self.workers):
            self.queue.put(None)
        for worker in self.workers:
            worker.join()
    def submit(self, job):
        self.queue.put(job)
    def _worker(self):
        while True:
            job = self.queue.get()
            if job is None:
                break
            job()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the downside of a dead-simple implementation is that it's not as friendly to use as <code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code>:</p>

<pre><code>urls = ['http://example.com/foo', 
        'http://example.com/bar']
results = [list() for _ in urls]

However I have an error with the Rmarkdown file. I have a similar structure to the drake example (<a href=""https://github.com/ropensci/drake"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/ropensci/drake</a>), where I load data, make a graph, then a plot and a summary table of my statistical analysis (with the R package kableextra).</p>
<p>Everything works when I select a .tex file, with following lines on my Rmarkdown file</p>
<pre><code>  output: latex_document

  tables: true
  graphics: yes

<p>and on drake plan</p>
<pre><code>report = rmarkdown::render(
knitr_in(&quot;Reports/report.Rmd&quot;),
output_file = &quot;report.tex&quot;)

<p>but when I want to have a compiled pdf file as an output with the following lines for rmarkdown header :</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So I have searched this error on the net, and go on the website of Yihui. I uninstall all TexLive from my computer, I have uninstall and re-install rmarkdown and tinytex. But it is not working and still have this error.
The error occurs just before the table from kableextra package. So I've found other said that adding <code>options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)</code> could help or adding <code>booktabs̀</code>  and <code>makecell</code> on the header of rmarkdown. But it still doesn't work :-/ Any ideas or potential links that I missed?</p>

<p>You can try and change your hadoop dependency to 0.20.2 and rebuild your MR job jar - if there are not compile errors then you're pretty close (there may be some bug fixes between 0.20 and 1.0.1 but i imagine you'll be ok). </p>

<p>If you do find that your job fails to compile, and it relates to some Input / Output formats not being available in 0.20 (like some of the Multi Input / Outputs), the you can check the Hadoop source for 1.0.1 (or indeed the Cloudera 0.20.2 source) to see if you can 'backport' the missing formats and add then into your job jar.</p>

<p>The .Net Standard .NET implementation support matrix at <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-1</a> does not contain an entry for 2.1 under &quot;Framework&quot;. Although very unlikely, the support matrix might change in time; this was the supported list at the time of writing.</p>
<p>More details on the decision by MS: <a href=""https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-1/</a></p>
<p>Extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given many of the API additions in .NET Standard 2.1 require runtime
changes in order to be meaningful, .NET Framework 4.8 will remain on
.NET Standard 2.0 rather than implement .NET Standard 2.1. .NET Core
3.0 as well as upcoming versions of Xamarin, Mono, and Unity will be updated to implement .NET Standard 2.1.</p>
<p>Library authors who need to support .NET Framework customers should
stay on .NET Standard 2.0. In fact, most libraries should be able to
stay on .NET Standard 2.0, as the API additions are largely for
advanced scenarios. However, this doesn’t mean that library authors
cannot take advantage of these APIs even if they have to support .NET
Framework. In those cases, they can use multi-targeting to compile for
both .NET Standard 2.0 as well as .NET Standard 2.1. This allows
writing code that can expose more features or provide a more efficient
implementation on runtimes that support .NET Standard 2.1 while not
giving up on the bigger reach that .NET Standard 2.0 offers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution:
The easiest way would be to convince the 3rd party to backport/multi-target to support netstandard2.0 as well. Alternatively, you can switch to targeting .Net 6 (LTS), .Net Core 3.1 (LTS), or Mono instead of Framework 4.8 in your project.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Another possible workaround:
You might also attempt some trickery with .NET Framework compatibility mode. I had no idea you could do this. You could, for example, make a &quot;wrapper&quot; project that targets standard and references both your .Net Framework 4.8 code and the 3rd party library, unless the 4.8 part uses WPF - perhaps there are other pitfalls in unsupported scenarios as quoted below. It sounds convoluted to me, but if you have no other option, it might be worth a shot. From the same original site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with .NET Standard 2.0, the .NET Framework compatibility mode
was introduced. This compatibility mode allows .NET Standard (*) projects
to reference .NET Framework libraries as if they were compiled for
.NET Standard. Referencing .NET Framework libraries doesn't work for
all projects, such as libraries that use Windows Presentation
Foundation (WPF) APIs.</p>

<p>Thanks i got the problem is was missing 'Z'. Z should be in single
quote as T</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>Using <code>'Z'</code> in the pattern will make <code>Z</code> treated as a character literal instead of as its intended meaning. The <code>Z</code> in the date-time string, <code>2017-03-09T18:30:00.000Z</code> is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">timezone designator</a> for zero-timezone offset. It stands for Zulu and specifies the <code>Etc/UTC</code> timezone (which has the timezone offset of <code>+00:00</code> hours).</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern date-time API</a><sup>*</sup>  is based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> and does not require using a <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> object explicitly as long as the date-time string conforms to the ISO 8601 standards.</p>
<p><strong>Demo:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import java.time.Instant;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Instant instant = Instant.parse(&quot;2017-03-09T18:30:00.000Z&quot;);
        System.out.println(instant);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>2017-03-09T18:30:00Z
</code></pre>
<p>For any reason, if you need to convert this object of <code>Instant</code> to an object of <code>java.util.Date</code>, you can do so as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Date date = Date.from(instant);
</code></pre>
<p>Learn more about the modern date-time API from <strong><a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trail: Date Time</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Using the legacy API:</strong></p>
<p>The legacy date-time API (<code>java.util</code> date-time types and their formatting type, <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>) is outdated and error-prone. It is recommended to stop using it completely and switch to <code>java.time</code>, the modern date-time API. Just for the sake of completeness, I have written below a solution using the legacy date-time API.</p>
<p>Use <code>X</code> to handle the <code>Z</code> in your date-time string. Check the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation page</a> to learn more about the symbols.</p>
<pre><code>import java.text.ParseException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {
        SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;y-M-d'T'H:m:s.SSSX&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
        Date date = sdf.parse(&quot;2017-03-09T18:30:00.000Z&quot;);
        System.out.println(date);// Note: will display date-time in your local timezone
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output in my timezone:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Thu Mar 09 18:30:00 GMT 2017
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>java.util.Date</code> object is not a real date-time object like the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern date-time types</a>; rather, it represents the number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as &quot;the epoch&quot;, namely <code>January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT</code> (or UTC). When you print an object of <code>java.util.Date</code>, its <code>toString</code> method returns the date-time in the JVM's timezone, calculated from this milliseconds value. If you need to print the date-time in a different timezone, you will need to set the timezone to <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and obtain the formatted string from it e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Date date = new Date();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
sdf.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;));
System.out.println(sdf.format(date));

<p><em><strong>Unfortunately, all existing answers have missed a crucial thing, <code>Locale</code>.</strong></em></p>
<p>A date-time parsing/formatting type (e.g. <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> of the modern API or <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> of the legacy API) is <code>Locale</code>-sensitive. The symbols used in its pattern print the text based on the <code>Locale</code> used with them. In absence of a <code>Locale</code>, it uses the default <code>Locale</code> of the JVM. Check <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/65544056/10819573"">this answer</a> to learn more about it.</p>
<p>The text in the expected output, <code>05.May 1988</code> is in English and thus, the existing solutions will produce the expected result only as a result of mere coincidence (when the default <code>Locale</code> of the JVM an English <code>Locale</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Solution using <code>java.time</code>, the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">modern date-time API</a><sup>*</sup>:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1988, 5, 5);
        final DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;dd.MMMM uuuu&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);
        String output = dtf.format(date);
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>05.May 1988
</code></pre>
<p>Here, you can use <code>yyyy</code> instead of <code>uuuu</code> but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/65928023/10819573"">I prefer</a> <code>u</code> to <code>y</code>.</p>

However, the tectonic plate's polygons seem to stretch across the world map (looking like they're at the opposite ends of the world, when they're actually side to side as the globe is round).</p>

There is also another <a href=""https://amoss.me/2013/06/apache-2-2-websocket-proxying-ubuntu-mod_proxy_wstunnel/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog</a> detailing step by step what you should do under Ubuntu.</p>

<p>After making sure you have the module and its loaded, you'll have to tweak your config to add some WebSocket proxying using the <code>ProxyPass</code> directive</p>

<pre><code>ProxyRequests    Off
ProxyPass        ""/socket-io/""  ""ws://localhost:8080/socket.io/""
ProxyPassReverse ""/socket-io/""  ""ws://localhost:8080/socket.io/""
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to try to use a rewrite condition on the Upgrade header that is sent with WebSockets:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} Upgrade [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*) ws://localhost:8000/$1 [P,L]
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/

Question is now how to keep those two different versions on GitHub or somewhere else. </p>

<p>One approach would be to have two different repositories named MyProject and MyProjectPreJDK8 (or MyProject and MyProjectJDK8), which seems ""inelegant"" to me, or have both versions in the same repository defining different source paths in maven for src/main/java and src/main/java8. I fear having different source paths in maven will result in a lot of work to get the built working (selectively preJDK8 or JDK8) and it will confuse users ... So in my utter desperation I thought I ask the community out there whether they have come up with something smarter ;-).</p>

You'll be able to find the fix in trunk (or in the 6.1 codebase). I found two commits in <a href=""https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal</a> that were labelled with LPS-13436 - you'd basically need to backport them to 6.0.6 yourself.</p>

"44352760","2017-06-04 09:47:34","2","","","","<p>The other answers were fine answers in 2012. Here’s an example of how to do with the modern (2014) Java date and time classes:</p>

<pre><code>    System.out.println(""date de la requete est "" + dateq);
    DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter
            .ofPattern(""EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss xx uuuu"", Locale.ROOT);
    OffsetDateTime dateTime1 = OffsetDateTime.parse(dateq, dtf);

    System.out.println(""new date "" + dateTime1);
</code></pre>

<p>The code example was inspired from a duplicate question (as I see it), <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44351846/how-to-convert-xml-string-date-to-int-in-java"">How to convert Xml String date to int in java</a>. With the example string from that question it prints:</p>

<pre><code>date de la requete est Tue Feb 08 12:30:27 +0000 2011
new date 2011-02-08T12:30:27Z
</code></pre>

<p>Q: I cannot use the newer classes on Android(?)</p>

<p>A: Yes you can. For Android, use the backport specifically tailored to Android, <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a>. Otherwise for Java 6 and 7, use <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen Backport</a>.</p>

<p>Q: Your code doesn’t work for the date-time string in <em>this</em> question!</p>

<p>A: (1) If you can, avoid the three and four letter time zone abbreviations like CEST. Many are ambiguous and interpretation may even vary with your JVM’s current time zone setting. CEST is just the summer half of a time zone, not a full time zone. (2) If you cannot get a string without <code>CEST</code> or similar in it, try using <code>ZonedDateTime</code> instead of <code>OffsetDateTime</code> and use <code>zzz</code> in the format pattern as in the question. This works in the example and produces <code>2012-04-08T16:37+02:00[Europe/Paris]</code>.</p>

<p>Q: How do I use the newer classes?</p>

<p>A: One good place to start is the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Q: <code>Locale.ROOT</code>??</p>

<p>A: If your date-time string comes from a specific place in the world and in the language of that place, use the corresponding locale, of course. If it’s just in English because computer systems everywhere tend to output English, I prefer to use <code>Locale.ROOT</code> for “the locale neutral locale”, like saying “do not do anything locale-specific here”.</p>

<p>This was indeed a problem with <code>java.util</code> date-time API until JSR-310 was incorporated in Java SE 8. The <code>java.util.Date</code> object is not a real date-time object like the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern date-time types</a>; rather, it represents the number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as &quot;the epoch&quot;, namely <code>January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT</code> (or UTC). When you print an object of <code>java.util.Date</code>, its <code>toString</code> method returns the date-time in the JVM's timezone, calculated from this milliseconds value.</p>
<p>The problem that you have described was addressed with the <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern date-time API</a><sup>*</sup> where we have <code>LocalDate</code> that represents just a date. In the following sentence, the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oracle tutorial</a> describes its purpose nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you might use a LocalDate object to represent a birth
date, because most people observe their birthday on the same day,
whether they are in their birth city or across the globe on the other
side of the international date line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/date.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A couple of pages later</a>, it describes it again as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A LocalDate represents a year-month-day in the ISO calendar and is
useful for representing a date without a time. You might use a
LocalDate to track a significant event, such as a birth date or
wedding date.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Which datatype should I use for <code>LocalDate</code>?</h2>
<p>It maps with <code>DATE</code> ANSI SQL type. The mapping of ANSI SQL types with <code>java.time</code> types have been depicted as follows in <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Oracle's article</a>:</p>

st.setObject(1, localDate);

If you use <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> (which you may not want to do, see below), I recommend you give it an explicit locale. The one you construct uses the device’s default, which explains why you get different results on different devices. If you want that, use <code>new SimpleDateFormat(""MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm a"", Locale.getDefault())</code> so the reader knows you have thought about it. To make sure you get AM and PM, use for example <code>new SimpleDateFormat(""MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm a"", Locale.ENGLISH)</code>.</p>

<p>Why would you not want to use <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>? I consider it long outdated since the much better replacement for the Java 1.0 and 1.1 classes came out with Java 8 in 2014. They have also been backported to Android Java 7 in the <code>ThreeTenABP</code>. Get this and write for example:</p>

<pre><code>    LocalDateTime gmt = LocalDateTime.of(2017, Month.JUNE, 6, 8, 15);
    DateTimeFormatter dateTimeFormat = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""MM-dd-uuuu hh:mm a"",
                                                                   Locale.ENGLISH);
    String dateAsString = gmt.format(dateTimeFormat);
</code></pre>

<p>The result is</p>

<pre><code>06-06-2017 08:15 AM

</code></pre>

<p>I am using two methods for community detection.</p>

<p>Using <code>edge.betweenness.community</code> I can split communities by calculating edge betweenness:</p>

<pre><code>wc &lt;- edge.betweenness.community(out, weights = E(out)$value, directed = FALSE, bridges=TRUE)
plot(wc, out)
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOqAe.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOqAe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Using <code>cluster_optimal</code> I can split communities by maximising modularity:</p>

<pre><code>co &lt;- cluster_optimal(out, weights = E(out)$value)
plot(co, out)
</code></pre>

<p>Data for co:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; co
IGRAPH clustering optimal, groups: 3, mod: 0.27
+ groups:
  $`1`
  [1] ""74"" ""80"" ""61""

  $`2`
  [1] ""1045"" ""1046"" ""1085"" ""1154"" ""1187"" ""1209""

  $`3`
  [1] ""1243"" ""1244"" ""1281""
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9KuA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9KuA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>At this point, I want to split these graphs into individual communities. This is done by cutting those edges that are highlighted red.</p>

<p>I can do this for <code>edge.betweenness.community</code> by returning those edges which are to be cut by doing:</p>

<pre><code>wc$removed.edges
[1]  3  6  5 17 14 11  8 15  7 12  1  2  4  9 10 13 16
</code></pre>

<p>I can then cut those edges:</p>

<pre><code>g2&lt;-delete.edges(out, wc$removed.edges[seq(length=which.max(mods)-1)])
plot(g2)
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b8cC5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b8cC5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But if I try this for <code>cluster_optimal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>co$removed.edges
NULL    
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like <code>cluster_optimal</code> has no attribute <code>removed$edges</code></p>

<p>I then looked in the documentation (<a href=""http://igraph.org/r/doc/communities.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://igraph.org/r/doc/communities.html</a>) and tried <code>cut_at</code> and <code>cutat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cutat(co, 3)
Error in cutat(co, 3) : Not a hierarchical communitity structure
&gt; cut_at(co, 3)
Error in cut_at(co, 3) : Not a hierarchical communitity structure
</code></pre>

<p>This has not worked either, even though <code>co</code> should be a community object.</p>

<p>How can I split my <code>cluster_optimal</code> graph into the individual communities like I did with <code>edge.betweenness.community</code>?</p>

<hr>

<p>Trying the suggestion posted, when i try to execute</p>

<pre><code>crossing(co, out)
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Each element must be either an atomic vector or a data     frame
.Problems: co, out.

In order to perform this action first of all you need to create a new Environment in Google Cloud Composer [2], once done, you need to install a new Python Package in your environment [3], and the package that you will need to install is [4] &quot;apache-airflow-backport-providers-google&quot;.</p>
<p>With this package installed you will be able to use these operations [5], the one you will need is [6] &quot;Start a DataFusion pipeline&quot;, this way you will be able to start a new pipeline from Airflow.</p>
<p>An example of the python code would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import airflow

from airflow import DAG
from airflow import models
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator

<p>You can set the time intervals by checking the Airflow documentation.</p>
<p>Once you have this code saved as a .py file, save it to ther Google Cloud Storage DAG folder of your environment.</p>
<p>When the DAG starts, it will execute task A and when it finishes it will execute task B and so on.</p>

"44373329","2017-06-05 16:22:37","2","","","","<p>If you're using <strong>Java 8</strong>, consider using the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">new java.time API</a>. It's easier, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1969442/whats-wrong-with-java-date-time-api"">less bugged and less error-prone than the old APIs</a>.</p>

<p>If you're using <strong>Java &lt;= 7</strong>, you can use the <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen Backport</a>, a great backport for Java 8's new date/time classes. And for <strong>Android</strong>, there's the <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a> (more on how to use it <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38922755/7605325"">here</a>).</p>

<p><em>Although you can also use JodaTime, it's being discontinued and replaced by the new APIs, do I don't recommend start a new project with joda. Even in <a href=""http://www.joda.org/joda-time/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">joda's website</a> it says: <strong>""Note that Joda-Time is considered to be a largely “finished” project. No major enhancements are planned. If using Java SE 8, please migrate to java.time (JSR-310).""</strong>.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>As you want to compare just the date (day/month/year), and not the time (hour/minute/second), the best choice is to use the <code>LocalDate</code> class. For java 8, this class is in <code>java.time</code> package, and in ThreeTen Backport, the package is <code>org.threeten.bp</code>. But the classes and methods names are the same.</p>

<p>The code would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>public int count(List&lt;LocalDate&gt; dateList, LocalDate today) {
    if (!dateList.contains(today)) { // today is not in the list, return 0
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;
    LocalDate prev = dateList.get(0); // get first date from list
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; dateList.size(); i++) {
        LocalDate next = dateList.get(i);
        if (prev.plusDays(1).equals(next)) {
            // difference between dates is one day
            count++;
        } else {
            // difference between dates is not 1
            // Do what? return 0? throw exception?
        }
        prev = next;
    }

    return count + 1; // didn't count the first element, adding 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>Testing this method:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;LocalDate&gt; dateList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 2));
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 3));
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 4));
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 5));
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();

System.out.println(count(dateList, today)); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Another test (when today is not in the list)</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;LocalDate&gt; dateList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 2));
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 3));
dateList.add(LocalDate.of(2017, 6, 4));
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();

System.out.println(count(dateList, today)); // 0
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As it wasn't specified what to do when the days are not consecutive (return <code>0</code> or throw exception), I left this part commented. But it should be straightforward to add this to the code</li>
<li><p>If you want to convert <code>java.util.Date</code> to <code>LocalDate</code>, you can do as follows (using the code <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21242110/convert-java-util-date-to-java-time-localdate/21242111#21242111"">of this answer</a>, full explanation is in this link in case you have any questions):</p>

<pre><code>public LocalDate convert(Date date) {
    return date.toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDate();
}

// if your Date has no toInstant method, try this:
public LocalDate convert(Date date) {
    return Instant.ofEpochMilli(date.getTime()).atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDate();
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I understood that you want to check for <strong>consecutive</strong> days (so, a 1-day difference between the dates). But if you want to check if the previous date is <strong>before</strong> the next (no matter how many days), you can change the <code>if (prev.plusDays(1).equals(next))</code> to <code>if (prev.isBefore(next))</code></p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure if that's the case, but if you want, you can also parse a <code>String</code> directly to a <code>LocalDate</code> (so you don't need to create lots of <code>Date</code> objects), using a <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""yyyy/M/d"");
LocalDate d = LocalDate.parse(""2017/6/2"", formatter); // 2017-06-02
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Afaik you are trying to update <code>php</code> to version 5.3.3, (and yet you've just install <code>php-common</code> in 5.3.10), staying with <code>php-ncurses</code> 5.2.12. I don't think that's going to work on any system. As you can see <code>php-ncurses-5.2.12</code> needs <code>php-common</code> in specific version (5.2.12 as well).</p>

<p>I'm almost sure that you should find backports of <code>php-ncurses</code> and <code>php-common</code> in 5.3.X version (same version for all the packages!) and then install it all together. If it's for some reason not possible, and if I were you I would probably remove <code>php-ncurses</code>, install <code>php-5.3.X</code> with <code>php-common-5.3.X</code> , then download and compile <code>php-ncurses</code> from source <a href=""https://pecl.php.net/package/ncurses/1.0.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a> (there is another version naming scheme though).</p>

<p>I know nothing about machine you are working on, but if it's production machine you should probably do some tests on mirror machine/system first to make sure you will not break anything.</p>

<p>As for the custom schedulers in Reactive Extensions, you can also use the SynchronizationContext mentioned above, for more information check the tutorial at <a href=""http://www.introtorx.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">introtorx.com</a> in particular <a href=""http://www.introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Part 4: Concurrency</a>.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<p>Of course you can roll <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/548865/Create-a-Custom-ThreadPool-in-Csharp"" rel=""noreferrer"">your own thread pool</a>, although doing that is not advised. Aside from that you could handle your threads manually - the old way.</p>

<p>Other approaches to handle tasks include <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2958191/402022"">scheduling with timers</a> and having dedicated threads to do the work.</p>

<p><strike>As part of the <a href=""https://github.com/theraot/Theraot"" rel=""noreferrer"">Theraot Libraries</a> you will find the class <a href=""https://github.com/theraot/Theraot/blob/14f808e4e89d7843349f5394a986bbee9a8e73f4/Core/Theraot/Threading/Work.cs"" rel=""noreferrer"">Work</a> which is based on a lock free queue and can be configured to have any number of dedicated threads, also threads waiting on tasks contribute their time to execute tasks, any extra work is delegated to the ThreadPool. This is part of an ongoing effort to backport System.Threading.Tasks to .NET 2.0.</strike></p>

<p>In <a href=""https://github.com/theraot/Theraot"" rel=""noreferrer"">Theraot Libraries</a> the Work class has been gone for a while now, a partial back port of <code>System.Threading.Tasks</code> for .NET 2.0 is available with support for custom TaskScheduler. </p>

However, the standards of C (and by extension, C++) have a very long history, dating back to the times when having a second pass over the code being compiled was very expensive due to slow access to files on magnetic disks. Relative shortage of memory has been a factor as well.</p>

<p>This consideration certainly contributed to requiring forward declarations in C, and C++ inherited it. Changing this requirement would introduce a very considerable change into the language, making it much harder to backport new programs to older compilers. It does not mean that it couldn't be done at some later time, but it hasn't been done at the moment. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure you're using Tcl 8.5</strong> (see what <code>package require Tcl</code> returns).
<ul>
<li>If you're using 8.4 (note: 8.4 EOLed this month), TclOO <em>will not work at all</em> (and it cannot be backported).</li>
<li>If you're using 8.6, it already provides the TclOO package and you shouldn't need to fuss around with all this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do a <strong>build of TclOO</strong> and install it to a location you prefer.
<ul>
<li>This <em>will</em> require Tcl's internal source files; TclOO explicitly pokes its nose into places where most code shouldn't.</li>
<li>You probably don't need to have a custom build of 8.5; just the <code>configure</code>d sources somewhere will do. (You might need to hack the configure scripts a little bit.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Add the location</strong> that you installed TclOO to to the search path inside your Tcl 8.5 program.</p>

<pre><code>lappend auto_path /the_dir/you_put/it_in
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using Windows, it's probably easiest to use forward slashes for this path anyway (this is a directory name that is always highly protected before it hits the OS, so that's OK).</p></li>
<li><p>Now you should be able to <strong>require/use the package</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>package require TclOO

oo::class create Foo {
    # etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the case and exactly how you write it matters. The version you get ought to be at least 1.0 (earlier versions were for development only) which corresponds exactly with the API as supported in Tcl 8.6 (modulo a few things that require 8.6 for other reasons, such as being able to <code>yield</code> inside a method which only works in 8.6 because that's where <code>yield</code> was first defined).</p></li>
</ul>

"44389569","2017-06-06 12:05:22","2","","","","<p>Yes, your approach seems fine and correct.</p>

<p>For your implementation: if you're using <strong>Java 8</strong>, consider using the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">new java.time API</a>. It's easier, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1969442/whats-wrong-with-java-date-time-api"">less bugged and less error-prone than the old APIs</a>.</p>

<p>If you're using <strong>Java &lt;= 7</strong>, you can use the <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen Backport</a>, a great backport for Java 8's new date/time classes. And for <strong>Android</strong>, there's the <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTenABP</a> (more on how to use it <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38922755/7605325"">here</a>).</p>

<p>The code below works for both. The only difference is the package names (in Java 8 is <code>java.time</code> and in ThreeTen Backport is <code>org.threeten.bp</code>), but the classes and methods <strong>names</strong> are the same.</p>

<p>To get the UTC time, you can use the <code>Instant</code> class. It's the best choice because it's always in UTC, and can be easily converted to and from another timezones:</p>

<pre><code>// get current UTC time - Instant is always in UTC
Instant instant = Instant.now();

// you can use the string representation
System.out.println(instant.toString());// 2017-06-06T11:57:21.665Z
// or the timestamp (epoch millis - milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)
System.out.println(instant.toEpochMilli());// 1496750241665

// convert to another timezone (always use valid IDs)
ZonedDateTime z = instant.atZone(ZoneId.of(""America/Sao_Paulo""));
System.out.println(z);// 2017-06-06T08:57:21.665-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]

// in another timezone
z = instant.atZone(ZoneId.of(""Europe/Berlin""));
System.out.println(z);// 2017-06-06T13:57:21.665+02:00[Europe/Berlin]

// convert back to UTC Instant
System.out.println(z.toInstant()); // 2017-06-06T11:57:21.665Z
</code></pre>

<p>The API uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IANA timezones names</a> (always in the format <code>Continent/City</code>, like <code>America/Sao_Paulo</code> or <code>Europe/Berlin</code>). Avoid using the 3-letter abbreviations (like <code>CST</code> or <code>PST</code>) because they are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18405262/what-are-the-standard-timezone-abbreviations/18407231#18407231"">ambiguous and not standard</a>. You can use <code>ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds()</code> to get a full list of all timezones names.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>ZoneId.systemDefault()</code> to get the system's default timezone. In this case, if the code runs on a server, it'll use the server's machine timezone. And if it runs in a device, it'll use whatever is configured in the device.</p>

"10067109","2012-04-08 22:35:04","0","","","","<p>You can try something like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>from xml.dom.minidom import Document

# Get all lineEdit values
elements = dict(
    mac = self.lineEdit_mac.text,
    broadcast = self.lineEdit_broadcast.text,
    destination = self.lineEdit_destination.text,
    port = self.lineEdit_port.text,
    destinationCheckBox = self.checkBox_destination.checkState,
    portCheckBox = self.checkBox_port.checkState
)

doc = Document()
wol = doc.createElement(""wol"")
doc.appendChild(wol)

for name, fn in elements.iteritems():
    node = doc.createElement(name)
    wol.appendChild(node)

    text = str(fn())
    nodeText = doc.createTextNode(text)
    node.appendChild(nodeText)

with open(fileName, 'w') as f:
    doc.writexml(f, indent='', addindent='  ', newl='\n')
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I suggested putting the functions as dict values as opposed to their actual text values is because you can use this elements dict as a config object for the xml process at a later stage. Then its just a matter of adding another element to the dict for inclusion.</p>

<p>As for reformatting your xml output, the way its doing it now is how the built in pretty printer works. Text nodes are just another type of child node so it uses a new indented line. You would have to do your own pretty printer function that manually loops over your dom and prints it the way you want (checking for text type nodes and printing them in the same line).</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't specifically bound to XML, you could shorten this even further using JSON if you wanted:</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>import json

elements = dict(
    mac = self.lineEdit_mac.text,
    broadcast = self.lineEdit_broadcast.text,
    destination = self.lineEdit_destination.text,
    port = self.lineEdit_port.text,
    destinationCheckBox = self.checkBox_destination.checkState,
    portCheckBox = self.checkBox_port.checkState
)

with open(fileName, 'w') as f:
    # if you need the root key
    data = {'wol': dict((name, str(fn())) for name, fn in elements.iteritems())}
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

    # or, just the key/values
    #json.dump(elements, f, indent=4, default=lambda o: str(o()))
</code></pre>

<h3>If order of the elements are important</h3>

<p>Using a dictionary will not maintain order of the original entries. If for some reason this is important you can just use a tuple:</p>

<pre><code>elements = (
    ('mac', self.lineEdit_mac.text),
    ('broadcast', self.lineEdit_broadcast.text),
    ('destination', self.lineEdit_destination.text),
    ('port', self.lineEdit_port.text),
    ('destinationCheckBox', self.checkBox_destination.checkState),
    ('portCheckBox', self.checkBox_port.checkState)
)

# and remove .iteritems() where previously used
for name, fn in elements:
</code></pre>

<p>In reviewing the answers from the question mentioned above, looks like the developer does not support reverting back to an older version of geopandas, as the past couple of releases require <code>geopandas&gt;=0.7</code>. Any help in resolving this issue would be very much appreciated! Thank you.</p>

"63657046","2020-08-30 11:40:35","4","","","","<p>With C++17's <code>std::optional</code>, here's an example that should work. For earlier versions of C++, you might want a backported <code>optional.h</code> and implement your own <code>optional_caster</code> similar to the one in <code>pybind11/stl.h</code>.</p>
<p>Say you want this function:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def add(a, b=None):
    # Assuming a, b are int.
    if b is None:
        return a
    else:
        return a + b
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the equivalent C++ pybind implementation:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>m.def(&quot;add&quot;,
    [](int a, std::optional&lt;int&gt; b) {
        if (!b.has_value()) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return a + b.value();
        }
    },
    py::arg(&quot;a&quot;), py::arg(&quot;b&quot;) = py::none()
);
</code></pre>
<p>In python, this function can be called with:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>add(1)
add(1, 2)
add(1, b=2)
add(1, b=None)
</code></pre>
<p>For numpy arrays, simply modify the <code>std::optional&lt;int&gt;</code> with <code>std::optional&lt;py:array&gt;</code> or <code>std::optional&lt;py:array_t&lt;your_custom_type&gt;&gt;</code> in the example.</p>

"44401927","2017-06-07 01:06:27","5","","","","<p>This depends on what you mean by <em>'most updated'</em>.</p>

<p>Actually, all of <em>jdk8u</em>, <em>jdk9</em> and <em>jdk10</em> repositories are kept up-to-date; they are just separate projects having different status and accepting different set of changes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>jdk8u</strong> has the most recent changes that will appear in the future updates of JDK 8. These updates mainly consist of bug fixes.</li>
<li><strong>jdk9</strong> repository contains up-to-date code that will be released soon as JDK 9. The project is now in <em>Rampdown phase 2</em> meaning that only showstopper bugs can be fixed there. It's not defined yet what will happen to this repository after JDK 9 release - e.g. give start for something like jdk9u.</li>
<li><p><strong>jdk10</strong> contains the ongoing work on future version of Java SE platform. Important improvements made here are likely to be backported to jdk9 sometime later (of course, if they comply with the specifications).</p>

<p>Note that new features are <strong>not</strong> developed directly in this repository. New features must go through <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1"" rel=""noreferrer"">JEP process</a>. Some bigger features may be even hosted in separate projects like <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Panama</a> or <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Valhalla</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The official repositories of OpenJDK projects are hosted at <a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://hg.openjdk.java.net</a><br>
To get the sources use Mercurial, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk10/jdk10
</code></pre>

<p>It contains several nested repositories. HotSpot JVM is under <code>hotspot</code>:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk10/jdk10/hotspot
</code></pre>

<p>Later you can use <code>hg pull -u</code> to sync your local repository with the updates from the master.</p>

<p>In the parent repository you'll also find the instructions how to get the sources and to build OpenJDK: <a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk10/jdk10/file/1bed3f29d894/common/doc/building.md"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>common/doc/building.md</code></a>. There is a <a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/file/d7537347a652/common/doc/building.md"" rel=""noreferrer"">similar document</a> in jdk9 repo.</p>

"44431658","2017-06-08 09:22:27","2","","","","<p>The answer of @Jens is correct and should be accepted. </p>

<p>I add some proposals <strong>how to improve the error handling</strong>. As you can see, <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> is silent about what is wrong with your code. And I am sure that this behaviour has already caused many people to release tons of parsing code with sometimes ""surprising"" behaviour. Fortunately you have found just <strong>by accident</strong> that something is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Java-8</strong></p>

<p>The new built-in library <code>java.time</code> (available since Java-8) would not parse but throw an exception</p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""dd-MM-YYYY"");
LocalDate d = LocalDate.parse(""30-12-2017"", dtf);
</code></pre>

<p>with following error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exception in thread ""main"" java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: 
  Text '30-12-2017' could not be parsed:  Unable to obtain LocalDate
  from TemporalAccessor:  {MonthOfYear=12,
  WeekBasedYear[WeekFields[MONDAY,4]]=2017, DayOfMonth=30}...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The existence of the field ""WeekBasedYear"" in the error message should enlighten you what is wrong so you go to the documentation to look for the right pattern symbol.</p>

<p>By the way, there is also a backport Threeten-BP available for Java-6+7. And I have now also tested the popular library Joda-Time:</p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(""dd-MM-YYYY"");
System.out.println(dtf.parseLocalDate(""30-12-2017"")); // 2017-12-30 (don't use it!)
</code></pre>

<p>So Java-8 is also an improvement for Joda-Time which does not see any problem in your pattern.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Here the construction of the parser fails with following message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:<br>

"44435387","2017-06-08 12:07:48","2","","","","<p>In <strong>Java &lt;= 7</strong>, you can use the <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThreeTen Backport</a>, a great backport for Java 8's new date/time classes.</p>

<p>With this, you can handle DST changes easily.</p>

<p>First, you can use the <code>org.threeten.bp.DateTimeUtils</code> to convert from and to <code>Calendar</code>.</p>

<p>The following code converts the <code>Calendar</code> to <code>org.threeten.bp.Instant</code>, which is a class that represents an ""UTC instant"" (a timestamp independent of timezone: right now, at this moment, everybody in the world are in the same instant, although their local date and time might be different, depending on where they are).</p>

<p>Then, the <code>Instant</code> is converted to a <code>org.threeten.bp.ZonedDateTime</code> (which means: at this instant, what is the date and time at this timezone?). I also used the <code>org.threeten.bp.ZoneId</code> to get the timezone:</p>

<pre><code>Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.setTime(new Date());

// get the current instant in UTC timestamp
Instant now = DateTimeUtils.toInstant(c);

// convert to some timezone
ZonedDateTime z = now.atZone(ZoneId.of(""Europe/Berlin""));

// today is 08/06/2017, so Berlin is in DST (GMT+2)
System.out.println(z); // 2017-06-08T14:11:58.608+02:00[Europe/Berlin]

// testing with a date in January (not in DST, GMT+1)
System.out.println(z.withMonth(1)); // 2017-01-08T14:11:58.608+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
</code></pre>

<p>I've just picked some timezone that uses Central Europe timezone (<code>Europe/Berlin</code>): you can't use those 3-letter abbreviations, because they are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18405262/what-are-the-standard-timezone-abbreviations/18407231#18407231"">ambiguous and not standard</a>. You can change the code to the timezone that suits best for your system (you can get a list of all available timezones with <code>ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds()</code>).</p>

<p>I prefer this solution because it's explicit what timezone we're using to display to the user (<code>Date</code> and <code>Calendar</code>'s <code>toString()</code> methods use the default timezone behind the scenes and you never know what they're doing).</p>

<p>And internally, we can keep using the <code>Instant</code>, which is in UTC, so it's not affected by timezones (and you can always convert to and from timezones whenever you need) - if you want to convert the <code>ZonedDateTime</code> back to an <code>Instant</code>, just use the <code>toInstant()</code> method.</p>

<hr>

<p>Actually, if you want to get the current date/time, just forget the old classes (<code>Date</code> and <code>Calendar</code>) and use just the <code>Instant</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// get the current instant in UTC timestamp
Instant now = Instant.now();
</code></pre>

<p>But if you still need to use the old classes, just use <code>DateTimeUtils</code> to do the conversions.</p>

<hr>

<p>The output of the examples above are the result of the <code>ZonedDateTime.toString()</code> method. If you want to change the format, use the <code>org.threeten.bp.format.DateTimeFormatter</code> class (take a look at the <a href=""http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/apidocs/index.html?org/threeten/bp/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">javadoc</a> for more details about all the possible formats):</p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(""dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss z X"");
// DST (GMT+02)
System.out.println(formatter.format(z)); // 08/06/2017 14:11:58 CEST +02
// not DST (GMT+01)
System.out.println(formatter.format(z.withMonth(1))); // 08/01/2017 14:11:58 CET +01
