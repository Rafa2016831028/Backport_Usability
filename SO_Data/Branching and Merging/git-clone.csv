If you gitignore files, those are the same for all branches, but unfortunately aren't tracked. When I run <code>git push</code> or the like, I need these files to passed between repos, etc.</p>

<p>For example, the data that is in .git folder is typically git-ignored. I want to add some data to my repo so that the data is independent of all branches, but still appears in all branches, and when you clone the repo, the data shows up.</p>

<p>Is this possible? So for example, if the <code>.git</code> dir looks like:</p>

<pre><code>.git/
  branches/
  hooks/
  objects/
  config
  HEAD
  index
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking of adding a folder:</p>

<pre><code>.git/
  .oresoftware/
</code></pre>

<p>and putting my data in there, where that data is independent of all branches.</p>

<p>I don't think this will work, because the data in the .git repo isn't really tracked. I am looking for something that's tracked by git, but is the same for all branches...</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After reading the answers and thinking about this for awhile, I thought maybe if I amend the initial commit with new files, then it could magically work, but of course that's not how Git works, each commit is a total snapshot, so changing historical commits after the fact won't change newer ones.</p>

<p>(for tl;dr, see #questions below)</p>

<p>I have multiple git repository shallow clones. I'm using shallow clones because it's a lot smaller compared to a deep clone. Each is cloned doing about <code>git clone --single-branch --depth 1 &lt;git-repo-url&gt; &lt;dir-name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This works fine, except I don't see how to update it.</p>

<p>When I'm cloning by a tag, update is not meaningful, as a tag is frozen point in time (as I understand it). In this case, if I want to update, this means I want to clone by another tag, so I just <code>rm -rf &lt;dir-name&gt;</code> and clone again.</p>

<p>Things get more complicated when I’ve cloned the HEAD of a master branch then later want to update it.</p>

<p>I tried <code>git pull --depth 1</code> but although I'm not to push anything to the remote repository, it complains it don’t know who I am.</p>

<p>I tried <code>git fetch --depth 1</code>, but although it seems to update something, I checked it is not up to date (some files on the remote repository have a different content than the ones on my clone).</p>

<p>After <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/20508591/279335"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/20508591/279335</a> , I tried <code>git fetch --depth 1; git reset --hard origin/master</code>, but two things: first I don't understand why <code>git reset</code> is needed, second, although the files seems to be up to date, some old files remains, and <code>git clean -df</code> does not delete these files.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Let a clone created with <code>git clone --single-branch --depth 1 &lt;git-repo-url&gt; &lt;dir-name&gt;</code>. How to update it to achieve the same result as <code>rm -rf &lt;dir-name&gt;; git clone --single-branch --depth 1 &lt;git-repo-url&gt; &lt;dir-name&gt;</code>? Or is <code>rm -rf &lt;dir-name&gt;</code> and clone again the only way?</p>

<p>I have configured the proxy in the file /etc/profile with the following lines</p>

<pre><code>export http_proxy=http://my_user:my_pass@xx.xx.xx.xx:yyyy/
export https_proxy=https://my_user:my_pass@xx.xx.xx.xx:yyyy/

<pre><code>wget https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
curl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

<p>Still I was getting the message so I tried to configure the proxy in git with the following commands</p>

git config --global http.proxy http://my_user:my_pass@xx.xx.xx.xx:yyyy/

<p>As last resort I tried to disable the proxy (because I thought that maybe it was an intern entreprise resource so it was conflicting with the proxy) but like this I wasn't able to resolve the host</p>

<p>Finally I also noticed that the log message had a trailing slash (/) so I tried to put the name of the repository between quotation marks ("""") but I wasn't able to remove the trailing slash from the log.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone ""https://cto-github.cisco.com/GDC-Interns-DevTeam/GDC-Dev-Back-End.git""

However what I'm interested in is pushing <strong>to</strong> a shallow server.</p>

<p>This doesn't work (I've served the git repo via ""git clone --bare --depth 1 the_original_repo"" in my server, and I cannot clone from it because it says it is a shallow clone). But I'm thinking that if one tries to clone with the same depth as the shallow clone was created, why would we have the limitation?</p>

<p>My end-goal would be something like this setup:</p>

(full-history-client)  (shallow-client)

<p>This way, both shallow nodes would have no history at all, but there would be a client which has the full history. If the shallow-client pushed to the shallow-server, it would mean that their depth increases, but ideally it would decrease again when the full-history-client pulls from the server.</p>

<p>How do you create a shallow copy with git-svn from a Subversion repository, e.g. how do you pull only the last three revisions?</p>

<p>The <code>git clone</code> command can get the last n revisions from a Git repository if you use the option <code>--depth</code>, i.e. you get a shallow copy of the repository. Example:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --depth 3 git://some/repo myshallowcopyrepo
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a similar option for git-svn?</p>

<p><strong>My discoveries so far</strong></p>

<p>So far I've only found the <code>-rN</code> option where <code>N</code> is the revision to pull. Example:</p>

<pre><code>git svn clone -rN svn://some/repo
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation there is the possibility to use <code>-r$REVNUMBER:HEAD</code>. I tried the following to get the last 3 revisions which returned an error message.</p>

<pre><code>$ git svn clone --prefix=svn/ -s -rHEAD~3:HEAD http://some/svn/repo .
revision argument: HEAD~3:HEAD not understood by git-svn
</code></pre>

<p>So I replaced <code>HEAD~3</code> with the actual number of the third but last revision 534. That worked, but that requires me to first figure out the revision number of the third but last commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git svn clone --prefix=svn/ -s -r534:HEAD http://some/svn/repo .

<p>What is an issue... I use to clone the same repo in the same command several servers (Ubuntu/CentOS). And using some servers it works perfectly - and takes approximately 20s.
And no information about downloading images is displayed.
But using some servers, information line by line about downloading images occurs - it takes a lot of time, because line by line information is displayed (it takes a few seconds to display another one line) - and finally it takes several minutes - instead of seconds.</p>
<p>This is strange. I checked a lot of configs, tried to compare environments - but I didn't find any solution.</p>
<p>Do you have idea?</p>
<hr />
<h2>edit after help below</h2>
<p>The solution is to upgrade the git. For older systems (like CentOS 7.x) default git version was a root cause.
It should be installed manually, to the newer git (for CentOS 7.x I installed git==2.16.5).

<p>of course the .git folder is not in version control, but you get the idea. And I want to copy the tools/*.sh to a local directory, at this path:</p>

<pre><code>./scripts/git/tools

<p>My current directory is a git repo that shares a totally different history than the remote git repo, I just want to copy some files from the remote, I don't want to merge anything.</p>

<p>I figure I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --path assets/tools/*.sh ""$remote_repo""  ./scripts/git/tools
</code></pre>

<p>but that command is not real, is there some command I can use to do this?</p>

<p>the only other way I can think of doing it, is cloning the whole repo to some temp directory and then copying the files over, but that's not as much fun.</p>

For web applications, we connect to the production server via SSH and pull the code in. Our issue is that only one person has permission to do a git pull when an update needs to be pulled to a server.</p>

<p>When a project is added to a server we would generally run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://username@bitbucket.org/team-name/test-repository.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you want to do a  <code>git pull</code> to that repository, you get prompted for your password: </p>

<pre><code>Password for 'username@bitbucket.org':
</code></pre>

<p>However, if a different user tries to do a <code>git pull</code>, they will also be asked for the original users password.
What we would like to do, is authorize our team, or at least some other sort of authorization where we could all do a <code>git pull</code> without having to ask someone else to log in and do it for each other.</p>

<p>I've tried cloning a git repo without the username:</p>

<pre><code>git clone bitbucket.org:team-name/test-repository.git .
</code></pre>

<p>But instead of that working, got this result:</p>

Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '0.0.0.0' to the 
list of known hosts.
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly   
</code></pre>

<p>We've also found another approach.  If I was to log in to do a <code>git pull</code>, you could use this command:</p>

<pre><code>git remote set-url origin https://username@bitbucket.org/team-name/test-repository.git
</code></pre>

<p>This would then allow you to point the repository to your latest commit, and do a git pull from there using your own password, but I still think there must be a better way.</p>

<p>There must be some way where you can simply login and use:</p>

<pre><code>git pull

<p>However, whenever I clone the repository I am still downloading about 3gb of objects. I worked around this issue by creating a new repository in Visual Studio Team Services and after pruning and garbage collecting my repository locally, then doing a push to there, it was reduced to 300mb.

<p>I want to do exactly what <code>git clone</code> does but with <code>libgit2</code>. What I may be asking is what <code>git clone</code> really does in depth.</p>

<p>This is what I'm doing so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initialize a repo</li>
<li>Adjust the config file to add the remote</li>
<li>Create a <code>git_remote</code></li>

<li>(edit) Write all the different branches to disk.</li>
<li>(edit) Do <code>git checkout</code> in some way.</li>
</ol>

<p><del>And now I have no idea what to do. My only guess would be to load the <code>.idx</code> to a <code>git_index</code> and use <code>git_repository_set_index</code>, but that didn't show any files either.</del></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I tested running <code>git checkout master</code> on the half-cloned repo, and that did the job. Now I just need to find out how to do it with libgit2, and it seems like there is some useful information in the issue tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> </p>

<p>I will now add my current code, in hope that someone someday will find it useful, in hope to be that quick-start code I never found. Note: I'm using <code>Obj-C</code> and <code>Objective-Git</code> here, but it's mainly plain c.</p>

origin                         git://github.com/OriginalOwner/SomeAmazingRepo.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>I <code>git clone --recursive</code> my project to begin a new spin-off project and when it begins to recurse, it spits out an error claiming it can't find the stored commits for these repos.  Upon inspection it seems that the remotes haven't been added and the branch is left (empty) in master ...</p>

<p>In local folder: MyProject2/Frameworks/SomeAmazingRepo/</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -vva
*master                        abcdef [origin/master] Latest commit msg from original repo

</code></pre>

<p>The only remedy is to go and add the remotes manually to all the repos (very tedious).</p>

<p>There exists a similar issue in the cases where there are two tracking branches as above but only one remote (origin => my github fork).  In these case, it finds the commit and checks it out but fails to recreate the tracking branch, leaving a ""dangling"" commit...very scary as it doesn't warn you!</p>

<p>How do I clone my project so that it reliably recreates the submodules' remotes and branches?</p>

<p>I have tried setting both one-line and multi-line versions using:</p>

<p><code>$ git config --global alias.cloneallbranches '...'</code></p>

<p>and tried to paste both versions into my .gitconfig file unsuccessfully (I have other git aliases, but none are bash scripts).</p>

<p>Can someone help me alter a bash script, so that I can paste it into my  .gitconfig file, to make the git alias works properly?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>

<p>Running a <em>separate bash script</em> as a ""git alias"" answer in reply below.</p>

<p>However, for those who want a quick way to add a git alias, <code>$ git clone-all-branches</code> here is an answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to updated answer here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-in-git"">How to clone all remote branches in Git?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Create a ""git alias"" which will run a script:</p>

<p><code>$ git config --global alias.clone-all-branches '! git branch -a | sed -n ""/\/HEAD /d; /\/master$/d; /remotes/p;"" | xargs -L1 git checkout -t'</code></p>

<p>Now you can run (from any directory that has a git repo):</p>

<p><code>$ git clone-all-branches</code></p>

<p>We have a big SVN repository (200k+ commits and hundreds of branches and tags). A big, ominous, unmaintainable, frustrating mess. To work more efficiently, about a year ago I did a git svn clone on my development machine, so I locally develop on GIT and then push to SVN.</p>

<p>We're now thinking about splitting up the repository and move the main development branches to git, or at least to move our development branch on git.</p>

<p>Since I have my local git repository, I wanted to do some test by cloning a part of it and push it to our company's GitLab, but without much success, probably because I lack the knowledge of some Git mechanisms</p>

<p><strong>Let's start</strong></p>

<p>In order to do some quick tests without pushing the entire 30GB repository, I wanted to do a shallow clone of my local Git repo and push the clone using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --depth=1 --no-single-branch file:///path/to/repo
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to clone the HEAD revision of every branch, but the clone included only the master branch and our development branch, nothing else (I'm not sure about the tags, I didn't check). After a while I realised that the clone included only our dev branch because it was the only one that I ever checked out (even though the git svn repository is a full clone of the SVN repository).</p>

<p>I then tried to do a</p>

<pre><code>git clone file:///path/to/repo
</code></pre>

<p>and I again got only the master and my development branch, nothing else.</p>

<p>In these two attempts I noticed that the clone was much smaller (200-700MB) than the original git repository (30GB). In the second try I was expecting a repository of the same size of the original. </p>

<p>So I realised that git is cloning only the checked out branches, not the remote ones (remotes/svn/*). Why, since the git svn repo is a full copy of the svn repo? Why is it not cloning all the branches? They are there (otherwise the git svn repo wouldn't be so big), they just aren't checked out. And... How we can talk of ""remote"" branches? Aren't they part of the git svn repo, and should be considered local?</p>

<p>So how could I tell git to consider all those branches when cloning the git svn repo? I wouldn't like to to a massive checkout of all the branches in the git svn repo, it sounds to me like a clumsy and messy solution. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I'm sorry for not replying you sooner, but you left me quite a lot of documentation to read, plus I had to do some other research on my own!</p>

<p>So, if my understanding is correct, my git-svn repository contains all the commits of the original svn repository and it's aware that the svn repository contains branches and tags, but locally it doesn't have the association between the commit's SHA1 and the label which is the branch name, and I have to add those associations manually.</p>

<p>Your snippet is a very useful starting point, thanks!</p>

<p>I also discovered the magic argument <code>--mirror</code> for the clone command, which imported also the remotes, so I didn't have to touch the git-svn repo, but I later created the branches directly on the cloned git repo.</p>

<p>Very well, now, considering the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don't have a local repository before a <code>git clone</code></li>
<li>hooks are not synced between remotes</li>
<li><strike>hooks stored in a custom template directory used with <code>--template</code> are copied non-executable and therefore <em>not</em> executed after <code>git clone</code></strike> (that is actually not true as stated by Jefromi in his answer, but the hook is still not executed)</li>

A similar question can be found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10361322/git-status-for-cloned-repository-shows-file-deleted"">here</a>, but I couldn't think of a way to phrase my twist on the question as an answer, so here I am.</p>

<p>Here's the rundown on the specifics of my scenario:</p>

<p>I have a repository on github. I am able to clone this repository as anyone would expect using git on Ubuntu 12.04. The problem arises when I try to clone the wiki (github makes this accessible via <a href=""https://github.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;.wiki.git"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;.wiki.git</a>). My resulting local copy is empty. Upon running ""git status"" I notice that the contents of the repo were deleted by some entity immediately after cloning.</p>

<p>On branch master</p>

<p>Changes to be committed:</p>

<p>(use ""git reset HEAD ..."" to unstage)</p>

<p>deleted: &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>...And so on for all the rest of the pages in my wiki.</p>

<p>""git branch -a"" returns the same thing for me as for the other guy:</p>

<p>*master</p>

<p>remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master</p>

<p>remotes/origin/master</p>

<p><strong>update 1</strong></p>

<p>It's true I was not aware of the difference between the staging area and the working directory, but it seems that was not the issue. On the other hand, it may have revealed a bit more of what is wrong.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that when I first clone the repository, I get the message ""cannot stat &lt;long_filename&gt;: filename too long""</p>

<p>When I run ""git reset"" all of the deletions are listed under ""unstaged changes after reset:"". The odd one out is &lt;long_filename&gt; which is listed as a merge instead of a deletion. Still, no files are visible in the directory I cloned to after the reset.</p>

<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>

<p>I can view all the wiki entries that should be present by using gitk from the cloned folder, but I am quite certain that the files are not present in a raw format anywhere on my filesystem, otherwise ""find / -name &lt;filename&gt; 2>/dev/null"" should return some useful output.</p>

<p><strong>update 3</strong></p>

<p>Apparently one of my filenames is too long for git to manage. Checking out the repo again after cloning it got all the files but that one:
<code>error: unable to create file &lt;filename&gt;.md (File name too long)</code></p>

Lets say i clone a git repo which has 10 files inside it.</p>

<p>Currently as i have just cloned , both my local copy and github repo are exactly same.</p>

<p>I now do two changes - One in my github repo and other in my local copy.
eg.
A) I added file 11 and 12 in my <strong>github repo</strong> .
B) I delete file 9 from my <strong>local copy .</strong></p>

<p>Now i want my local copy to get synced with my github repository such that it exactly mirrors it ( basically that same state if i would have deleted my local copy and recloned it ) </p>

<p>ie 
A) it should add new files 11 and 12 from git repo
B) it should bring back file 9 present in git repo</p>

<p>After googling a bit , i found that we can use <strong>git pull origin master</strong> to update our local copy of repo 
But running that said - <em>already up to date</em>...</p>

<p>git remote -v had the remote -origin pointing to my github repo so that's absence of remote is not the issue..</p>

<li>Mount the USB thumb drive on my desktop PC and push those commits up to the master/bare repository</li>
<li>Pull the changes into my desktop development tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>And then I would like to do the reverse of this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make changes to my desktop working git tree, add, commit, push them to the master repository.</li>
<li>Mount the thumb drive on my desktop PC, pull/fetch the master changes into the git clone on the thumb drive.</li>
<li>Mount the thumb drive on an embedded system, pull/fetch the changes into the local working tree on the embedded system ...</li>
</ol>

<p>The end goal is to be able to make development changes on my desktop PC or on any of my embedded systems (which do not have network ability) and keep everything in sync.</p>

<p>Is this possible?  Is this possible without massive amounts of git voodoo?</p>

<p>I've sat down to work through this on a couple occasions and keep running into road blocks.  I don't think I want a --mirror'd repository on the thumb drive because I want to be able to push changes both directions through the thumb drive.</p>

<p>I could put the official master repository on the thumb drive and have all my working copies point to that I suppose, but that doesn't give me warm fuzzy feelings about the security of my master copy if it gets buried.</p>

<p>I'm hoping for something 'simple' that I can understand and do myself!</p>

The goal is to clone only a specified submodule 'jenkins-config' so we need the URL (we know this already) and the commit.</p>

<p>Use Case: 
We want to use a Jenkins job configuration which specifies what to do with the checked out sources in our Pipeline. Because we do not know what is configured we first want to clone only the configuration, process it and then check out the whole repository (e.g. on the correct node). </p>

<p>We would really like to have the configuration next to the sources of the repository to be built. This is why we had the idea to use a ""config submmodule"" to include and specify the valid configuration (valid configuration is specified by the SHA of the submodule).<br>
This would also enable to select a specific configuration for your branch. Also the maintenance of configurations for different repositories would be quite comfortable using different branches in the configuration-repository (pull changes). </p>

<p>Any ideas how to solve this?

<p>I would like to put something in my <code>~/.gitconfig</code> that would set <code>user.email</code> differently for my work projects than my hobby projects. (Remember, I can't use <code>.git/config</code> because it periodically gets wiped out.) This could be based on the project name, or based on the URL of the remote repo I'm cloning.</p>

<p>As a separate but related issue, I would love to be able to specify a global pre-commit hook that applied to <em>all</em> my repositories, rather than having to remember to modify <code>.git/hooks/pre-commit</code> every time I clone a repo. (I am aware of <code>git clone --template</code>.)</p>

This remote is called <code>origin</code>. I then cloned that repo on other computers at a later time. Since I created <code>origin</code>, I make sure I always keep it up to date by pushing all my changes from any computers to it. I then pull those changes back to the other computers so that my working directories are all the same.</p>

<p>The other day I decided to reorganize my external HDD. I created a new bare repo (let's call it <code>other_remote</code>) in a different location on the drive, added it as a new remote to my working directory on one of my computers and pushed that working directory to it.</p>

<p>Now, I was going to erase the repo <code>origin</code> from my HDD, but before proceeding, I had doubts and I decided to compare the two remote repos to make sure I was not doing something that I would regret.</p>

<p>I started with <code>du</code> and I got this:</p>

<pre><code>$ du -sch origin                                                                                                                                  
207M    origin
207M    total

$ du -sch other_remote                                                                                                                      
34M     other_remote
34M     total
</code></pre>

<p>Now that scared me! I obviously didn't erase <code>origin</code> yet. I did a lot of research (here and on google) but I couldn't find any info about that.</p>

<p>The only thing I found was someone saying that you can use <code>git count-objects -v</code> to get a good estimate of the size of a repo. But again, this command gives quite different results on my two bare repos:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd path/to/origin
$ git count-objects -v
count: 137
size: 211976
in-pack: 0
packs: 0
size-pack: 0
prune-packable: 0
garbage: 0

$ cd other/path/to/other_remote
$ git count-objects -v
count: 6
size: 9888
in-pack: 131
packs: 1
size-pack: 24725
prune-packable: 0
garbage: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone help me understand why my two remote repos are so different? Is it safe for me to erase <code>origin</code> and only keep <code>other_remote</code>? Will I loose some information if I do so?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>

For now I've been using  TortoiseGit, more or less how I used to use TortoiseSvn, but with <em>local</em> commits, branches, merges, rebases, cherry picking.</p>

<p>It is a big project and switching a branch and recompiling everything takes too long. This is why I want to have two (or more) working trees corresponding to two branches of the Subversion project.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible to share the .git folder for the two working trees (its 5GB), or I need to clone the repository or maybe checkout it again from subversion (it took several hours).</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-as-a-Client"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""git book"">git book</a> it seems that interaction between two git repositories will not work well if they interact with svn as well (I don't know if this applies to my case):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don’t push to a parallel Git repository to collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time. Subversion can have only a single linear history, and confusing it is very easy. If you’re working with a team, and some are using SVN and others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate – doing so will make your life easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to have a single repository with all svn branches and all my local branches and I would like have several working trees to avoid the need to rebuild everything after switching branches. Is that possible?</p>

<p>The problem is I can't figure out how to tell <code>git clone</code> to use active mode for FTP. When I set <code>GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1</code> and did a <code>git clone ftp://user:pass@server/repo</code>, I noticed that it is sending <code>PASV</code> instead of <code>PORT</code> and hangs just like curl without the <code>-P -</code> switch. How do I tell it to do otherwise? I read a bit about the <code>_netrc</code> file but couldn't find an example to set up active mode through it.</p>

<p>For anyone curious, here are the verbose curl outputs from <code>git clone</code> (pretty much the same as running <code>curl</code> without specifying the <code>-P -</code> option.)</p>

<pre><code>* About to connect() to server.com port 21 (#0)
*   Trying {server ip}... * 0x98d548 is at send pipe head!
* Connected to server.com ({server ip}) port 21 (#0)

</code></pre>

<p>With the <code>-P -</code> option specified for curl, <code>PORT</code> command will be used in place of <code>PASV</code>, so starting from the <code>EPSV</code> line the following commands will be sent instead to the server:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; EPRT |1|{client ip}|13375|
&lt; 500 'EPRT |1|{client public ip}|36093|': command not understood
* disabling EPRT usage

<p><strong>update</strong> git version is: 2.14.1 on Windows 7 prof</p>

<p>We have new projects that are empty except they have one commit with a .gitignore file in them. Lets say one of these projects is called ""projectA.git"".</p>

<p>So my method is:</p>

<ol>
<li>clone template_proj.git into a folder called ""Project_A"". For this I use: <code>clone template_prog.git --depth=1 --recursive</code></li>
<li>Remove the remote: <code>git remote rm origin</code></li>
<li>Add the new remote: <code>git remote add origin projectA.git</code></li>
<li>Forcefully merge the projects: <code>git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This works well. <strong>Note:</strong> The main reason that I don't just delete my .git folder from the template clone is that it has submodules.</p>

<p>This gives me a repo with 3 commits (which are exactly what I want):</p>

<ul>
<li>the tip of template_proj.git</li>
<li>the tip (and only commit) of projectA.git</li>
<li>the commit that contains new merge of the two.</li>
</ul>

<p>However there is the special tag/branch ""grafted"" associated with the <code>the tip of template_proj.git</code> commit. I don't really want that.</p>

<p>So my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this an efficient way to do this operation (i.e. is there a better way)?</li>
<li>How do I get rid of the <code>grafted</code> tag?</li>
<li>What is the <code>grafted</code> tag?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have not been able to fully understand what <code>grafted</code> really is/means - I did search for it and found some information but still not really sure. As a keyword in a git search it got over-ruled by more common items (or my google-fu is weak) :(</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also this question here does not quite answer:  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27296188/what-exactly-is-a-grafted-commit-in-a-shallow-clone"">What exactly is a &quot;grafted&quot; commit in a shallow clone?</a> - because it does not really say why grafted is there or what to do about it (if anything).

<p>Basically, my team is starting a new project in our own git repo which will have other github projects as dependencies. We expect we will have to do edits on those dependencies which we want to push back to our own repo so everyone on the team can sync them. We would also like to take updates to the dependencies from the original GitHub repo as we would like to eventually push back the changes in our repo to GitHub. Does this make sense so far?</p>

<p>Ok, so the way I wanted to lay out our project is something like follows:</p>

<pre><code>root
|- src                    &lt;- Our code goes here
|- upstream               &lt;- GitHub dependencies go under here
   |- GitHub project A
   |- GitHub project B
</code></pre>

<p>So I thought the way one goes about doing this is to for each GitHub dependency, <code>git clone</code> the GitHub repo to the desired directory, and then <code>git remote set-url origin &lt;our repo url&gt;</code> and then <code>git remote add upstream &lt;original github url&gt;</code>. I thought then I'd be able to make changes, add, commit and finally push to our repo. And when desired, pull from the upstream remote to keep stuff up to date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this didn't quite work out, after I did <code>git add .</code> from <code>root</code>, doing <code>git status -s</code> would not show the files in the GitHub directories as added. Doing a commit and push put things in what looked like a half baked state and then I started stressing out because I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>

<p>So if anyone can share some help I would greatly appreciate it, but please talk to me like I'm five years old. </p>

<hr>

<p>The preferred way of setting up a virtual environment using Python 3 is:</p>

<pre><code>python -m venv &lt;path&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> directory, if it does not exist, and populate it with the following:</p>

<pre><code>Include/

pyvenv.cfg

<p>If the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> specified exists, and is not empty, then it will fail.</p>

<hr>

<p>If then you try then to clone a git repo to the same directory, and it is not empty, the git clone will fail.</p>

<p>Given that when running each command, the directory must be empty, how to work this?</p>

<p><strong>Say I want to git clone to:</strong></p>

<p>Is this the way things work?</p>

<hr>

<p>I am activating the directory using Windows Powershell, by first cd'ing to the directory</p>

<pre><code>C:&gt;cd c:\dev\repos\my_project

<ul>
<li>Host &amp; git authentication happens via ssh key</li>
<li>ssh key forwarding is enabled</li>
<li>Every user of our team uses a dedicated user account - it is not possible to log in via headless user account</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we want to deploy an application from a git repository. This should be simple but it's not.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Clone app repo
  git:
    repo: githost:org/repo.git
    dest: /some/location
    version: HEAD
    force: yes
    ssh_opts: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  notify:
    - Restart app
</code></pre>

<p><sup><sub><em>githost</em> is an entry in our .ssh/config</sub></sup></p>

<p>This above task works. But the repository is (of course) cloned as the user who executed the playbook. What we need instead is:</p>

<ul>
<li>All files should be owned by a headless user, let's call him <code>zaphod</code></li>
<li>Only <code>zaphod</code> is allowed to <strong>read</strong> the files. We're talking about 0600/0700 permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following task will not work, because by using <code>become</code> we will lose the forwarded ssh key and therefore git authentication will fail:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Clone app repo
  git:
    repo: githost:org/repo.git
    dest: /some/location
    version: HEAD
    force: yes
    ssh_opts: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  notify:
    - Restart app
  become: yes
  become_user: zaphod
</code></pre>

<p>The following variation would first call a handler which changes ownership of the checkout before (re)starting the application:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Clone app repo
  git:
    repo: githost:org/repo.git
    dest: /some/location
    version: HEAD
    force: yes
    ssh_opts: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  notify:
    - Fix ownership
    - Restart app
</code></pre>

<p>This works once. But if you run the playbook a 2nd time the git task fails because the user who runs the play does not have permissions to modify the clone.</p>

<p>We have a very ugly solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone into /tmp/foo</li>
<li>Fix ownership of /tmp/foo</li>
<li><code>rm -rf /some/location</code></li>
<li><code>mv /tmp/foo /some/location</code></li>
<li>Finally (re)start application</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with this is that this would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trigger a restart every single time the playbook is executed</li>
<li>The Ansible summary shows 5 changed tasks, even though nothing happened - except the restart which was not required in the first place</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm a bit picky here, but I do only want to have changed states if something really changed, so in a perfect world not even the git task would have a changed state. And for this I do not see a solution. Because we require that the cloned files are only accessible by <code>zaphod</code> - but <code>zaphod</code> himself is not able to clone the repo. So there has to be some manipulation is some form resulting in changes.</p>

<p>Any suggestions how this can be improved in a clean way? I don't want to add another 20 tasks shuffling around with temporary copies, temporarily changing permissions, comparing files manually and so forth...</p>

<p>Of course a custom written module would be able to deal with all this - but I'm more interested in something that does not take 2 days in development and battle testing. ;-)</p>

<p>I have a netbeans project that uploads files to my remote development server.</p>

<p>The project I'm working on was perfect for open source, so I created a new github repo.  There were a lot of configuration files and other tidbits (like .htaccess files, etc.) that I did not want to include in the repo, so I just copied the files that I wanted into a new directory, created a git repo there, and I've been using that to push files to github.</p>

<p>Whenever I complete some new development in netbeans, I have to copy the new or edited files to the repo directory, commit the changes, and finally push to github.</p>

<p>I realize now that I can use a .gitignore file (git is new to me!).  So I think it would be wise/faster to ignore the troublesome files and commit changes from the same directory I'm working in, thus eliminating the need to copy to the other directory.  I assume that means I need to clone the repository into the directory I use for netbeans, but git tells me ""that directory already exists.""</p>

<li>Once the changes are safe to push to remote, then pull the changes from L to L1 </li>

<p>My thoughts are that I code on my laptop, at the minute when I want to put my program on a server, which happens to be the raspberry pi sitting under my desk, I simply SCP to it.</p>

<p>I was wondering how using git I can update files in a directory. For example all I need to run the bot is two files.</p>

.  ..  bot.py  .git  .gitignore  Insult.txt  README.md

<p>This is the result from simply cloning the repo, however I don't need most of these files/directories. I don't need .git, .gitignore or README.mb. I also need to keep a credentials.json file in tact that isn't in the repo as it contains sensitive data accessed by bot.py.</p>

<p>What's the best way to make some sort of 'update' function that simply grabs the files bot.py and any other files that I need, in this case Insult.txt, replace the existing copies and keep credentials.json untouched, without other redundant git files.</p>

<p>I understand, this may not be the best approach, I'm looking to find the best approach, so please feel free to contradict what I'm saying, I don't know if keeping the git repo is a <em>good</em> thing for example. But all I simply need is the latest versions of bot.py and the other files in a directory so I can run them on my pi.</p>

When cloning this repository git checks out 'master', if 'master' and 'testing' are on the same revision (i.e. HEAD == testing == master).
Only if 'testing' is one (or more) commit(s) behind or ahead, git clone checks out the 'testing' branch on the local side. 
I tried this with git 1.7.5 on Mac OS X (10.6.8).</p>

<p>Addendum:
I just tried the same with a non-bare repository:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir A
cd A
git init
touch a
git add a
git commit -m ""init repo A with a""
git checkout -b testing
</code></pre>

<p>now back in the root dir:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
git clone A B
cd B
git branch -v -a
* master                 28f599b init A
  remotes/origin/HEAD    -&gt; origin/master
  remotes/origin/master  28f599b init A
  remotes/origin/testing 28f599b init A
</code></pre>

<p>it's 'master'! Back to repo A (we are still in branch 'testing'):</p>

<pre><code>cd ../A
touch b
git add b
git commit -m ""add b in branch testing""
</code></pre>

<p>now 'testing' is one commit ahead 'master'. Now let's clone A again:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
git clone A C
cd C
git branch -a -v
* testing                23bca39 add b in branch testing
  remotes/origin/HEAD    -&gt; origin/testing
  remotes/origin/master  28f599b init A
  remotes/origin/testing 23bca39 add b in branch testing
</code></pre>

<p>You can re-verify this weird behavior by going back to A, checkout 'master' and merge it with 'testing' (so that all branches have the same head). Now clone A into D and D will be checked out on master!</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with <code>git fetch --all</code>, <code>git pull --all</code> or <code>git svn</code>. It's just about copying the remotes of a remote to a clone.</p>

<p>The remote has its own remote named <em>svn</em> which contains some branches:</p>

<ul>

<li>refs/remotes/svn/trunk</li>
<li>refs/remotes/svn/branch1</li>
<li>refs/remotes/svn/branch2</li>

<li>(refs/remotes/origin/master)</li>
<li>refs/remotes/svn/trunk</li>

<li>refs/remotes/svn/branch2</li>

<p>I can't use <code>git clone --mirror</code> because that creates a bare repository.</p>

<p>Our company is currently using svn. Meanwhile I'm preparing the migration from svn to git. </p>

<p>My expectation is the clone carries out the check-out based on remote's HEAD which points to certain commit on remote.<br>
<strong>What is the possible reason of the check-out stage had been skipped?</strong><br>
During the clone process was in progress I created small readme file in the working space. However that file stays untracked up to this moment. There is no plan to track that file.<br>
<strong>Can this file creation have disturbed clone process so it could not include check-out stage?</strong>  </p>

<p>So, I aborted it because am used to have straightforward clone process, furthermore not the slightest idea about all resulting effects on confirming to continue on unauthenticated host.</p>

<pre><code>git help clone
</code></pre>

<p>and the examples made there use among others following URL format  </p>

<pre><code> The following syntaxes may be used with them:
   ·   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
   ·   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

<p>As for used setup following applies as well:  </p>

<pre><code>ubuntu@site3-user03:/$ sudo find / -type f -name known_hosts
[sudo] password for ubuntu:

</code></pre>

<p>One time in the past I have had similar effect with other clone. That time it was clone of Linux kernel public repo for MSM SoC. However, that time the clone process generated also some message of the kind ""unable to clone because no ??? found on remote"". Forgotten what ??? read. So in the end-effect I had also to do check-out manually subsequently to clone process. However, such warning did not come in this case, forking alsa-driver public repo.</p>

<p>I'm working with a repo that is very large because of commits of numerous large files. I recently shallow cloned it (depth=1), then later pulled a large change on master. Then I branched, made a small commit, and pushed to that new branch. It's taking forever to push it up, even though it's only adding a small commit (15 kb, one file affected) on top of commit that the remote (Bitbucket) already knows about. The message I see looks like this:</p>

I have two bare repos <code>repo1.git</code> and <code>repo2.git</code>. The first is located in <code>/var/www/git/repo1.git</code>, while the second is a symbolic link:</p>

<pre><code>/var/www/git/repo2.git -&gt; /other/folder/repo2.git

<p>Now, if I go with the web browser to <code>http://myserver.com/git/repo1.git</code>, I can see the internal files of the bare repo and if I go to <code>myserver.com/repo1.git</code> I can see similar files (I can go also in the subdirectories).</p>

<p>I can clone <code>repo1.git</code> via <code>git clone http://myserver.com/git/repo1.git</code> without issues.</p>

<p>The problem is when I try to clone <code>repo2.git</code>:</p>

<pre><code>fatal: repository 'http://myserver.com/git/repo2.git' not found

<p>I have enabled the hook post-update in both the repos.

Somebody committed some huge (by git's standards) binaries early in the project's life. Rewriting git's history just to get rid of them seems like too much trouble, so we figured doing a shallow clone that avoided those big early commits would be good enough.</p>

<p>I did some experiments with <code>--depth</code> parameter for clone and encountered some weird behavior. This is what help for git clone says about it:</p>

<pre><code>--depth &lt;depth&gt;
           Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits. Implies
           --single-branch unless --no-single-branch is given to fetch the histories near the tips of all
           branches. If you want to clone submodules shallowly, also pass --shallow-submodules.
</code></pre>

<p>This would indicate that <code>&lt;depth&gt;</code> will equal the number of commits that will be fetched during the clone, but it's not the case. This is what I got when I tried different values for depth:</p>

<pre><code>| depth   | commit count linux repo | commit count git repo |

<p>For cloning I used this command <code>git clone --depth 10 https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git</code>, <code>git clone --depth 100 https://github.com/git/git.git</code>, and for counting the commits I used this <code>git log --oneline | wc -l</code>. (At work I observed the same thing with a GitLab server, so it can't be an artifact of how GitHub works.)</p>

<p>Does anybody know what is going on? How does the value for depth correspond to the actual amount of data downloaded? Do I understand the documentation wrongly, or is there a bug?</p>

<p>EDIT: I added results for a second repo</p>

Currently they do a git clone using the ""--depth 1"" and ""-b {branch}"" options to get a specific code branch as quickly as possible.  But this is still wasteful since a fresh copy is being checked out (over the network) every time a job executes, even if there are very few (if any) changes.</p>

<p>Instead, what I'd like to do is have a shared local repo on the build machine that's a clone of our remote repo.  Each job would do a ""git pull"" on a specific branch to bring in any changes from the remote repo, then copy the source tree from the repo to its Jenkins workspace before starting the build.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a bad idea?</strong></p>

<p>What concerns me is the possibility that different jobs targeting the same code branch will be run simultaneously, which could result in concurrent ""git pull"" requests.</p>

<p><strong>Could this result in corruption of Git's meta-data?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is one of the concurrent pulls likely to fail due to locking issues?</strong></p>

<p>The shared local repo would never have any changes committed to it and nothing would ever be pushed from it to the remote repo.  It would be ""pull only"", so to speak.  All the pulls would come from the same user, so there shouldn't be any file permission issues.</p>

I noticed many other postings containing ""warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository"", but most were due to having failed yo commit anything to the source repository.  So it is possible the circumstances in this report get lost in noise.</p>

<p>As a question - what is the cause?, and any similar experience?</p>

<p>To add the certificatefile provided in the ssh config. It sounded like I would need to add that public key of the private key used to sign the user key (that generated the certificate). However, I won't have access to the private key for the cert available on the bitbucket server.</p>
<p>Separately, I was able to grab the public cert from altssh.bitbucket.di2e.net:443 and I did try using this, but still got a bad request... This probably doesn't make sense to use since this is in PEM format, but I figured it was worth a try.. </p>

<pre><code>git clone &lt;URL&gt; working-copy

<p>With branches you can just <code>git clone -b &lt;BRANCH&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</code></p>

<p>With <em>branches</em> you can also make a shallow-clone which makes cloning much faster but then you can't checkout an arbitrary ID any more.</p>

<p>So my question is: is there a way to make a shallow clone of a given URL/commit ID without having to create a branch on the remote?</p>

<p>Are there differences for different types of remote repositories? (e.g. local file system, BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, etc.)</p>

<p>From some other questions (and prior experience), I know this usually means the file is being used by another process. What I don't understand is: how is that possible here? This file is being created by the clone operation, so I couldn't run another process on that file even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, however, if I instead use a remote desktop program to access my work computer (which has the server mapped as a network drive), the operation is successful (as long as I use the network drive name and not the IP address).</p>

<li>I am connected to the server via a VPN, sending commands via Git Bash.</li>
<li>The server is running Windows Home 10.0.18363 N/A Build 18363 (it's just a desktop tucked away in a corner).</li>
<li>I'm using <code>git version 2.27.0.windows.1</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>For a slightly more convoluted version of this story (should it be relevant), read on.</p>
<p>I've been having trouble with this origin repo all day, starting with <code>missing blob</code> or <code>failed to read delta-pack base object</code> errors when trying to push to it. Googling those errors made it seem the problem was likely some file corruption.</p>
<p>So I logged into the server, made a bare clone of my version of the repo (which I was earlier trying to push), erased the remote pointing to my version and then modified my repo to point to the new repo in the server (keeping the previous version safe just in case).</p>
<p>With this I got everything working and managed to make further pushes to the new repo.</p>
<p>However, when I then tried making a new clone of the repo, I got the error above.</p>

lrwxrwxrwx 1 git  git    18 Jan  7 06:48 repo -&gt; /media/raid/repo//

/media/raid/repo [The preferred location]
drwxrwxr-x  7 git     git     4096 Jan  4 10:33 test.git/

OK  - git clone gitserver:/home/git/test.git
OK  - git clone gitserver:/home/git/tst.git
NOK - git clone gitserver:/home/git/repo/test.git
NOK - git clone gitserver:/media/raid/repo/test.git
</code></pre>

<p>Is this some basic Linux security that I missing or is this a git problem?</p>

However, you don't need any branches nor do you want the very long commit history. What you want is a <em>shallow</em> clone as a <em>snapshot</em> of the most current status of the repo. Preferably with the latest commit messages, only, while still showing from what point in <code>A</code> it was forked from. This is graphically shown in GitHubs <code>Insights &gt; Network</code> tab, as arrows going from one users repo to another. </p>

<p>The problem is that of the solutions I've tried to so far, all end up making a <strong>gap</strong> in the GitHub <code>Network</code> graph. This is probably because they all rely on either removing/restoring <code>.git</code> or <em>force</em> pushing which seem to cause the GitHub UI to disconnect the clone/fork, and instead it end up looking like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhkYd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhkYd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm not sure how to best phrase this question as there are already several dozens that sound very similar if not the same, while none of them seem to address this issue, if it is even possible.</p>

<p>So the question is: </p>

<p><strong>How can I keep the forks dependency in GitHubs <code>Network</code> graph, while still having removed most of the commit history?</strong></p>

<p>(I understand that I can't remove the <em>whole</em> history and still have <em>something</em> connected in the graph, but shouldn't it be possible to squash the fork in such a way that all commits in <code>A</code> is turned into <em>one</em> squashed commit (as seen from the fork), while all new ones in <code>B</code> are normal?)</p>

<li>My global git config transforms this into a SSH request.</li>

<p>HOWEVER - </p>

<p>If I git clone another module recursively which includes module_K as a sub-module it fails ...</p>

<li><p>But - when it gets to Module K - it reverts to https and wants my username and password.</p></li>

<li><p>I've already tried the ""cut/paste"" same URL so that I don't make stupid typos... that's not helping.</p></li>

<p>Unknowns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I trace the GIT activity... as it reads the config file. Suggestions?</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried things like 'strace' to see if something is being passed on the command line somewhere - but - I think GIT is very security aware and does not do this sort of stuff on the command line -  - </p></li>
<li><p>Also tried - ""ps -auxwwf"" while this is occuring is not helping determining the command line between various sub-components of git.</p></li>

Each project has its own <code>.git</code> folder but it doesn't matter. Git doesn't see the repo.
I've been trying to find a solution for two days now, and I didn't format my pc yet just in case

I believe that is something related to the files inside <code>.git</code> folder, <code>HEAD</code> file is not in the <code>.git</code> folder, it doesn't exist. Thank you</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>:<br />
Today, <code>gitversion</code> failed unexpectedly when this Jenkins job was run to build a git branch that I cannot see anything unique about (versus the many successfully-built branches).<br />
The error, below, seems to indicate an inability to identify development or release branches, which are <code>dev</code> and <code>master</code>, respectively, in our case.</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I have tried</strong>:<br />
When I manually clone the repo and check out the branch using the above git commands, I can reproduce the <code>gitversion</code> failure.</p>
<p>When I &quot;simplify&quot; my git clone and branch checkout to just:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.company.com:7999/PRJ/repo.git
$ git checkout feature/hcf
$ docker run -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) --rm -v &quot;$(pwd):/repo&quot; artifactory.company.com/gittools/gitversion:5.7.1 /repo
</code></pre>
<p>...then <code>gitversion</code> succeeds and returns an expected value.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>:<br />
Can the Jenkinsfile <code>checkout()</code> statement be modified so that it is functionally identical to the &quot;simple&quot; <code>git clone</code> and <code>git checkout</code> statements? There is obviously some salient difference between the two &quot;methods&quot; of cloning from git and checking out branches that is relevant to <code>gitversion</code>.<br />
If possible, I would prefer a solution that uses the Jenkins pipeline <code>checkout()</code> function over a shell script invocation like <code>sh(script:&quot;git clone...&quot;)</code> -- but perhaps an experienced answerer can convince me that that preference isn't justified.</p>
<p>Can someone explain how I can determine what is &quot;unique&quot; about this particular git repo or branch? With other repos/branches, the above <code>checkout()</code> statement in our Jenkinsfile continues to work simpatico with the subsequent <code>gitversion</code> invocation. So it would seem there is something unique about this one failing case that I don't know how to determine.</p>

It is apparent that we need some version control, and so I am trying to set up git.</p>

<p>I really would like to keep the setup simple and straightforward.  We don't need any sort of integrator to look over our changes - we are both fully trusted to push changes to the production site.  I also don't see any need to push changes to a staging server before making them live, as there's nothing we could test there that we can't test on our local machines.  I basically just want something which will keep us from clobbering each other's files.  Here is the scenario I have in mind:</p>

<li><p>Is there any advantage at all in adding a staging server in between the developers and the production server?</p></li>
<li><p>I assume the production server should be a bare repo with a post-receive hook pointing to the webroot folder, that we would clone a copy to each developer's machine, and then git commit / git push to launch any changes back to production?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any easy way to create a bare repo on the production server and then add the site's existing 15,000 files to it?  Or do I have to download them to the clone repo on my local workstation and then do git add / commit / push to get them loaded in the production server repo?  (They could take almost 13 hours to upload.)</p></li>

Just adding the main reason why I want to do this as to shape some of the answers down an acceptable path ;)</p>

<p>Goal is to have a branch in my repo that tracks the upstream's master.</p>

<pre><code>[remote ""upstream""]
    url = git://github.com/bob/awesomeproject.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
[branch ""father""]
    remote = upstream
    merge = refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the branch ""father"" which is in my repo tracks the remote called upstream's master branch.</p>

<p>It all works great once I set it up, but as soon as I clone the repo again, the ""father"" branch points to origin instead of the upstream.</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@192.168.0.62:axelle/prog.git

fatal: git upload-pack: aborting due to possible repository corruption on the remote side.
remote: aborting due to possible repository corruption on the remote side.
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
</code></pre>
<p>As I use the repository from another host without any problem, <strong>I don't think there is any corruption</strong>. Rather, when I log <strong>on the server, I see RAM go drastically down,</strong> then basically the Pi freezes, and a short while after I get the error on client side, and my Pi server regains its memory. So, I think <strong>my clone fails because I fall out of memory on the Rpi</strong>.</p>
<p>I have seen several solutions which basically consist in using commands such as the following. But to be honest, I don't really understand if I should put a small window memory &amp; size limit, or a big one. Anyway, I tried with 20m and 100m, and nothing worked :(</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global pack.windowMemory &quot;100m&quot;
$ git config --global pack.SizeLimit &quot;100m&quot; 
$ git config --global pack.threads &quot;1&quot;
$ git config --global pack.window &quot;0&quot;
$ git config --global core.bigfilethreshold 200K
</code></pre>
<p>With regards to <em>big files</em> - which might be another reason the clone fails, I probably have a few big files, but not too much. <em>How can I check what's the biggest file of my repository</em>? and should I then set <code>core.bigfilethreshold</code> slightly above?</p>
<p>Also, I saw some people recomment <code>git fsck</code>, but that does not work for me because my repository is not cloned.</p>
<p>Finally, I am not sure that the commands above will solve my problem, and I'd appreciate anyother solution so that I can clone my repo :) If there's a way to see the issue precisely on server's side, let me know too.</p>

<pre><code>git clone --bare -l /home/jaimemontoya/public_html/app/public.git /home/johndoe/app/public.git
</code></pre>
<p>He continued coding and when he uses <code>git remote -v</code> he gets this:</p>
<pre><code>origin    ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git (fetch)
origin    ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git (push)

<p>He had the latest code so at one point I wanted to get the latest version of his code by using this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone --progress -v &quot;ssh://jaimemontoya@example.com/home/johndoe/app.git&quot; &quot;C:\Users\jaimemontoya\Apps\Marketing\app&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>To my surprise, when I navigate to <code>C:\Users\jaimemontoya\Apps\Marketing\app</code> and use <code>git log -1</code>, I'm getting a very old commit, not the most recent one that my team member has when he uses <code>git log -1</code> from his local. He claims to have already pushed to remote, meaning <code>ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git</code> should already have his latest code so that when I clone from it, I should also be able to fetch the latest. My first guess is that he may not have pushed to remote. But assuming he has already done it, what could explain why I'm not being able to retrieve the latest code from <code>ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git</code>?</p>
<p>Note: I used <code>root</code> to try to explore <code>ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git</code> and see what I get:</p>
<pre><code>root@sub.example.com [~]# cd ../home/johndoe/app.git/
root@sub.example.com [app.git]# ls -al

</code></pre>
<p>I'm still seeing an old commit, not the latest one that my team member claims to have already pushed to remote. This happens even after logging in as <code>root</code> to the server where the code is being hosted. This is a bare repository. However, shouldn't <code>.git</code> list the latest code pushed to <code>ssh://johndoe@www.example.com/home/johndoe/app.git</code>, when use use <code>git log -1</code> from <code>/home/johndoe/app.git/</code> on the server where the remote repository is hosted?

<p>My company has set up a git server.  I have a private ssh key on my personal computer from which I can access that server, read from git, and write changes to git.</p>

<p>I also need read access to git from a server where other people have root access.  I'm not willing to put my private git ssh key with read-write access on a server where other people can read it.

<p>Is there a way that I can add a key to git that has my credentials, but only read access?  If not, can I at least set up git on my server account so that it knows my user name, and I only have to type in my password?</p>

<p>The situation: 
On my server there are users like <em>git</em> and <em>user1</em>. Former is supposed to manage/store my git projects and have them accessible locally and remote. The latter is just a plain user I use to run telegram bots or something else.
Usually I create a bare git repository for user <em>git</em> like <code>project1.git</code> and in user <em>user1</em>'s directory there already are subdirectories like <code>project1</code> which I turn into a git system via <code>git init</code>.</p>

<p>Following instructions like <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ProGit</a> I link <code>project1</code> to <code>project1.git</code> as <em>user1</em> like this from <code>project1</code>'s directory:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin ssh://git@hostname:1234/pathToGituserDirectory/project1.git 
</code></pre>

<p>After this I can <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code> like it is supposed to be.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, I would like to save the detour via <code>ssh</code> and clone the repo from user <em>git</em>'s <code>project1.git</code> locally. </p>

<p>As <em>user1</em> from <code>/pathToUser1Directory/</code>'s directory the following is working as well: </p>

<pre><code>user1@hostname:~git clone /pathToGituserDirectory/project1.git. /pathToUser1Directory/project1-clone
Cloning into './project1-clone'...
done.
</code></pre>

<p>Problematic is the use of <code>git push</code> from <em>user1</em>'s newly cloned <code>project1-clone</code>. </p>

<pre><code>user1@hostname:~/project1-clone$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 3, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 255 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
^C
user1@hostname:~/project1-clone$
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, pushing added and committed files is not working quite well, since git is stuck  somewhere town the road and I have to intervene.
The added and committed files do not show up on other (remote) members accessing this repo. </p>

<p>Due to my (yet) limited understanding and short experience of git, my questions here are: </p>

<ol>
<li>What is the best way to clone locally from user <em>git</em> (guessing
via <code>ssh</code> is not necessary)</li>
<li>Where did I go wrong/how can I push
files from locally cloned directories.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully someone can track my explanation and has some ideas. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>PS: I could add user <em>user1</em> to the same group of user <em>git</em>, but there is no difference to what I described</p>

<p>PPS: user <em>git</em> is restricted to <code>git-shell</code>, but that's probably not the issue</p>

<p>I have a remote <a href=""https://github.com/PackardChan/chk2019-blocking-extreme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub repositories</a>, which uses git-lfs to hold large binary files. </p>

<ul>
<li>I want others to be able to quickly download my code and data.</li>
<li>If speed can be enhanced, I don't expect others to necessarily version control their copies of the repository with git.</li>
<li>Preferably, I want to know the reason of being slow or being fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Baseline approach (<code>git lfs clone</code>)</h2>

<p>As a test of how others will download my repository, I ran the following command on a high performance login node (with 72 Intel Xeon CPUs) on a Linux cluster, using a gpfs disk, and with these versions of git and git-lfs.</p>

<ul>
<li>git version 2.10.2</li>
<li>git-lfs/2.3.4 (GitHub; linux amd64; go 1.9.1; git d2f6752f)</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>

<p>This took near 5 minutes even in a high performance node. And I noticed that the last line of output reaches the total of 7.29GB only in 36 seconds. The rest of the time is running <code>git update-index -q --refresh --stdin</code> (from what I learn from <code>top -c</code> command).</p>

<p>I therefore believe the performance can be substantially improved if update-index can be skipped. As mentioned in ""Objectives"", if speed can be improved, I don't mind giving up git version control.</p>

<li>svn export</li>
</ol>

<p>Inspired by this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/18324428/9382524"">post</a>, I tried:</p>

<pre><code>time svn export https://github.com/PackardChan/chk2019-blocking-extreme/trunk z4svn

<p>But the lfs files are not correctly downloaded. This is also reported <a href=""https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Is-git-LFS-compatible-with-SVN-client-support-on-GitHub/m-p/5346/highlight/true#M1737"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<ol start=""2"">

<p>It seems that the main repository is accessed correctly through ssh, but the submodule wants to use HTTP authentication, which is not an option for me. The clone worked just fine on a separate Linux machine (I need the repository on both), so I also wonder if this is a Mac-specific issue.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force the submodule to be downloaded with ssh authentication? Or otherwise fix the download?</p>

I am using the <a href=""https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">git-tfs tool</a> with the following syntax to create a local copy of the primary source branch:</p>
<p><code>git tfs clone --all --with-labels &lt;server&gt;:8080/tfs/ $/&lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
<p>The process takes about 30 hours and when that completes I have a directory structure of ~45 GB that contains a ~6 GB .git repository sub-structure.  When I attempt to push this to our agency GHE I get errors regarding large files, because the agency doesn't have Large File Storage enabled and has no plans to enable it.</p>
<p>I have brought this to the attention of my superiors and been instructed to <em>&quot;remove the large files and make the upload.&quot;</em>  I ran an audit of all files &gt;20 MB as instructed and have a spreadsheet I can copy/paste into Notepad++ for scripting the removal process.</p>
<p>I have attempted a <code>git rm</code> and then a <code>git commit -m</code> on the larger files, but am learning that this doesn't work as the changelog still tracks the large files.  The <code>git push</code> to GHE command simply threw back the same errors I was seeing before.</p>
<p>My research has led me to several solutions, such as <a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BFG Repo-cleaner</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">git filter-repo</a>.  Both tools require a --mirror copy of the repository, which git-tfs doesn't support.  Git-tfs only supports a --bare option and the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation for git clone</a> doesn't help me understand the difference.  I understand that both are just the repository directory and not the raw file structure, but not much more.  I also do not understand how to push a mirrored local copy that doesn't have a file structure into GHE.</p>
<p>I've raised these issues to my leadership and been instructed to:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git-tfs clone</code> TFS to local</li>
<li><code>git clone --mirror</code> the local copy to a secondary local copy</li>
<li>Attempt to run BFG or git-filter-repo against the secondary copy</li>
<li>???? [I don't know what comes after this]</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm unclear on several things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Doesn't the mirrored secondary still point to the TFS as origin?</li>
<li>Do I have to push the secondary local to the primary local and then push the primary local to GHE, as the secondary has no file structure?</li>
<li>How do I perform an audit of the changelog to see what was modified to ensure that history is preserved?  I don't want to be punished 6 months or a year from now because the developers are looking for a specific change and can't find it.</li>
