<p>Error on LFS Pull git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'. The most similar command is log</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Gitkraken documentation (<a href=""https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/intro-and-requirements/#git-lfs-requirements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) we find the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If GitKraken still cannot find Git or Git LFS, the terminal or CMD may be using a different path than the system or user path. For example, on OSX applications launched from the GUI have a different path than those launched from the terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To check this, we can do the following command: <code>which git-lfs</code> and <code>which git</code></p>
<p>Indeed, I get the following result:</p>
<pre><code>which git     /usr/bin/git \
which git-lfs /opt/homebrew/bin/git-lfs

<p>Then, the documentation says that you have to add an environment variable in the path, the example is given for windows, but I can't reproduce the equivalent for macOS</p>
<p>In my .zshrc I have this: <code>export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH</code></p>
<p>I tried it with: <code>export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin/git-lfs:$PATH</code> but it doesn't work</p>

<p>So I think GitKraken software <strong>needs to access a gitconfig file</strong> to get things work, and it somehow <strong>tried to access the one at <code>/etc/gitconfig</code> first</strong> (which is locked - <em>I don't even know what ""lock"" mean</em>), so it threw the error. After googling, I found a solution sounds rational is to type <code>chmod 777 /etc/gitconfig</code> to give everyone (includes GitKraken) <strong>the permission</strong> to read/write to that config file. But after doing that, it still not work (permission denied), even after a reboot. <strong>First attemption failed</strong>. Maybe <strong>it's not about permission</strong>?</p>

<p>I then kept googling, then I knew that there are 3 types of config files for git, which are <strong>local</strong> (located in <code>.git/gitconfig</code>), <strong>global</strong> (in <code>~/.gitconfig</code>) and <strong>system</strong> (in <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>). Then I thought <strong><em>""aha, I could just delete the <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>, then Kraken will use <code>~/.gitconfig</code>""</em></strong>. And yet after deleting <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>, it works <em>(I can clone my repo as expected)</em>. But I think it's just a <strong>workaround</strong>, I don't know what's the consequence of doing this (deleting system gitconfig). As I read in the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">document</a>, it should <strong>first read the local one, then global, then system</strong> in order, so it should <strong>only read <code>/etc/gitconfig</code> if only can't find one in <code>~/.gitconfig</code></strong>, am I right? Why it isn't the case here? Or does GitKraken deliberately setting to read the config file from <code>/etc/gitconfig</code> first instead of the above order? </p>

<p>Conclude, I deleted the system gitconfig <code>/etc/gitconfig</code> (by renaming it to <code>/etc/.gitconfig</code> btw). My question is what should I do now, did I solve my problem? If yet then now I don't fully understand what's going on, please can someone explain to me? </p>

Recently started using gitKraken to test how it works (thinking of moving from sourcetree). From what I understood it is more like ""raw"" git command. SourceTree does things for me like auto tag pushing (ok, found that it allows for not recommended <code>--tags</code> option)</p>

<p>My problem are tags. I tested it on console and it seems to be related to pushing tags.</p>

<p><code>git push origin</code> - pushes changes<br>
<code>git push origin 1.0.0</code> - pushes tag<br>
Here, everything is OK. My coworkers see changes and can pull it.</p>

<p><code>git push origin 1.0.0</code> - I push tag only, <strong>without commit (How is this possible?)</strong><br>
It is visible on Repository (on BitBucket site) like a normal commit - with comment and ID. However commit cannot be downloaded from bitbutcket via git pull since it states it is up-to-date</p>

<p>I have a <em>feeling</em> that it looks like<br>
<code>git push origin</code> = <code>git push origin</code><br>
<code>git push origin 1.0.0</code> = <code>git push some-special-place</code></p>

<p>How exactly does it work? I can see all changes on BitBucket site.</p>

<p>Moreover I can download commited tag without commiting chnages and result I get is latest normally commited. Which can lead to problems in case I use API/Site to download repo copy, as it is not aligned with real changes</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> <em>If My local commits are <code>A-B-C-D(tag)</code> and remote are <code>A-B-C</code> then BitBucket Interface shows me (after commiting a tag only) <code>A-B-C-D</code> and does not state that <code>HEAD</code> is on <code>C</code> Instead of <code>D</code>. That's what I thought I downlaod latest commit, but in reality What I was downloading was HEAD<br>
Also, to note: Removing tag from remote removie</em> <strong><em>uncommited</em></strong> <em>commits - like they were never there in first place.</em></p>

<p>GitKraken nor source tree does not inform about changes not being commited.</p>

<p>Edit: Commiting only tag shows real changes (<em>patch summary</em>) in web interface. Commit looks exactly as real one.</p>

When I use <em>git</em> and <em>git flow</em> from the command line, the operations taken are different from what Gitkraken performs.  On the command line, doing <code>git merge</code> by default does a fast forward.  Gitkraken does not fast-forward when merging.  When using <em>git flow</em> from the command line, finishing a feature also does a fast forward by default.  When finishing a hotfix, if <em>nobackmerge</em> is false and <em>notag</em> is true, gitflow will merge master into develop, which seems at odds with the git flow workflow.  This does not happen in Gitkraken when a hotfix is not tagged.  I looked through Gitkran's <em>.gitkraken</em> directory and could not find any git settings.  I also looked in the <em>.gitconfig</em> directories where I used Gitkraken, hoping to find what settings it uses.  It appears Gitkraken passes built-in default arguments to the git commands that it runs without disclosing it, and ignoring any user Git settings. So far, by using <em>git flow</em> on the command line and Gitkraken in separate directories, and then looking at the <em>git reflog</em>, I've been able to find that these settings are being emulated:</p>

<pre><code>[merge]
    ff = false
[pull]
    ff = true
[gitflow]
    multi-hotfix = true
[gitflow ""hotfix.finish""]
    nobackmerge = true
    no-ff = true
[gitflow ""feature.finish""]
    no-ff = true
</code></pre>

<p>These options are selected interactively</p>

<pre><code>[gitflow ""hotfix.finish""]
    notag = true|false
    keep = true|false
[gitflow ""feature.finish""]
    notag = true|false
    keep = true|false
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to set up .gitconfig so that command line Git's default behavior approximates Gitkraken's behavior.</p>

<p>We have some projects with git in it that cause serious issues. One main was that we work in almost daily is a Magento 1.9 site (although, we have other Magento 1.9 sites on git repos that have no problem with Atom). What happens is we open the project in Atom and we cannot open any files. It seems to hang on initializing git info (folders stay uncolored). </p>

<p>Sometimes when we open up the project in Atom it works, most of the time it doesnt. We HAVE noticed a 1:1 correlation with GitKraken when this occurs - when we try to open the repo in gitkraken we get an error that it could not find any repo - even though it actually loads the repo just fine, albeit after a long delay. Other time this does not occur, and that's when it opens fine in Atom. We could leave it sitting there for a couple of hours untouched and come back to it and all of a sudden we cannot open any files. This happens to all users in the office.</p>

<p>The problem with atom is definitely related to git. If we remove the repo and open the project then it works with no issues.</p>

<p>I thought, maybe repo size or history had something to do with it, so we tried initializing a fresh repo, added the files and made our first commit, and still the same problem. Our git ignore file is almost identical to the other magento sites that have no problems with Atom or Gitkraken.</p>

<p>Honestly it's such a weird problem I don't even know who to submit the bug report to, and we haven't found anything in our searching.</p>

<p>**** One thing that we've discovered of note, every time we have this issue, if we run Git GUI within that git repo folder (simply just open git gui) then all of the problems with Atom and GitKraken disappear for a time. Eventually the problems just come back though.</p>

<p>I pushed commits to Pantheon's DEV environment, deployed on both TEST and LIVE environments. Later I did a hard reset to a certain commit and forced pushed to origin. Fast forward, when I cloned the repo again, I can still see the commits that I thought I had erased from history.</p>

<p>I can't see them in terminal with <code>git log</code> but I like to use GitKraken to visually see my git history, and there they appear all the time. I tried to wipe the local repo because thought it was simply a local thing— on Pantheon's DEV environment they are gone after the force push.</p>

<p>Nothings seems to solve this for me. Please help! My OCD is preventing me to ignore it and continue to do work and keep adding commits. I need my history to only show the commit where HEAD is currently at, and commits ahead of that to be gone from sight.</p>
