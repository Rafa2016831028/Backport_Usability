I am using feature and bugfix branches (feature/ISSUEKEY-23123-some-feature) and I would like to prepend the ISSUEKEY-23123 into the commit message:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch | grep '*' | sed 's/* //')
STR=`echo $BRANCH_NAME | grep -E 'ISSUEKEY-[0-9]*' -o`
if [[ $BRANCH_NAME == *""feature""* ]] || [[ $BRANCH_NAME == *""bugfix""* ]]
then
    echo $STR &gt; $1
fi
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but it discards the standard message vi is showing me for commits, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# Explicit paths specified without -i or -o; assuming --only paths...
# On branch feature/ISSUEKEY-1716-model-implement
# Your branch is based on 'origin/feature/ISSUEKEY-1716-model-implement', but the upstream is gone.
#   (use ""git branch --unset-upstream"" to fixup)

#       new file:   asd
#
# Untracked files:
#       FSTD-1716
#       TMP
#
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to either prepend the <code>STR</code> to the output, or to call a git command what prints me the mentioned standard commit message?</p>

<p>The opened commit message should be:</p>

<pre><code>ISSUEKEY-1716

As part of our build-script, we verify that all parts of a project are on an appropriate branch, and are tagged correctly.</p>

<p>We have been using <code>git submodule foreach --recursive ""git branch -r""</code> to determine the branch name, but over time we've seen an increasing amount of falsely reported branch names.</p>

<p>I currently have a project where two of three submodules consistently are reported on wrong/invalid branches. :-(</p>

<p>All three submodules have been updated recently, going through the whole workflow, and are all on master now.
The main repository has had it's submodules updated, and have been tested on all stages of the workflow. </p>

<p>During the build the correct source if fetched, and the git tag (if set) can be verified. However, for some submodules the branch name returned are wrong or invalid. :-(</p>

<p><strong>Background update</strong>: Partial fix; It turned out the invalid branch names were caused by a lack of branch history which in turn were due to a 'stuck' value in the <strong><em>advanced submodule</em></strong> settings of the <strong><em><a href=""https://jenkins.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jenkins</a> Git plugin</em></strong>, whereby a shallow clone would always be performed on submodules. Updating the plugin fixed this part of the problem, so now branches are always returned, just not always the expected branch.

<p>I'm really struggling to understand the output. The hash values certainly are associated to a merge to master, but the various commands either returns nothing, unknown, a wrong branch (here develop) or a truncated (but correct) hash.</p>

<p>For all of this, it should be noted that teh BitBucket GUI shows everything correct, I just expected to be able to do the same with CLI commands.</p>

<p>How do I proceed from here?</p>

<p>I created a huge project locally, <strong>initialised a repository and added everything to that repository</strong> with <code>git add .</code> I then tried to push this to a private repository on Bitbucket I had access to, but it wouldn't accept my logins.

<p>I feel sick. I think it's just completely destroyed a weeks work. Beginner here, aright? Would you lay off the finger wagging for one second? Yes, I should have pushed more incrementally.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do the same with a commit that is already merged into the main line? I tried the exact steps mentioned above but not only it did not work well, but also doubled the number of commits because there were conflicts. See more or less the problem:</p>
<p>I added five commits and merged them all. Then I wanted to fix &quot;commit 1!&quot; but still have a clean history at the end (only five commits in my case)</p>

I work at a startup where all of us have technical experience, but none of us have worked at software development companies.  We have been arguing about the best way to organize our code in our bitbucket repository/ies.  </p>

<p>We have some PHP code for the front end of our website, and some Matlab for the backend (the Matlab is being complied to work with the PHP, but I don't think that is relevant).  The PHP code is used exclusively for the website, but the Matlab is worked on by many developers making changes, some relevant to the website and some not.</p>

<p>We have come up with three schemes for how to organize the code:</p>

<p>Scheme 1: Put the Matlab and PHP in the same repository.  Branch the Matlab into ""Website"" (a.k.a. stable main branch), ""Develop1"", ""Develop2"", etc.  The developers work on their own branch, and periodically we merge the Develop branches into the Website branch.</p>

<p>Scheme 2: Put the Matlab and PHP in the same repository.  Developers who want to work on the Matlab fork the Matlab into other repositories, then submit pull requests when they want their code merged with the website Matlab code.</p>

<p>Scheme 3: Put the PHP in one repository and the Matlab in another.  Then the developers fork or branch as described above.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?  The DBA in our company says that it is a terrible idea to put two types of code in the same repository (and at some point, it would be three, since we will be slowing changing the Matlab code over to C or some other language).  On the other hand, I worry that it will be hard to keep track of which versions worked with each other for the PHP and Matlab if they are in separate repositories.</p>

<p>I read a number of posts on stack overflow that partially answered my questions:</p>

<p>This helped me understand the difference between branches and forks - it would appear to me that branches simply require more trust in the developers, since they can merge without permission or code review.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences"">git branch, fork, fetch, merge, rebase and clone, what are the differences?</a></p>

<p>This seems very close to my question, although when I showed it to the DBA, he said it isn't a good example since Java and Javascript are so similar.  However, the answer written here seems to point to my Scheme 1.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5127910/how-to-organize-shared-code-assets-across-projects-with-git-repositories"">How to organize shared code/assets across projects with git repositories</a></p>

<p>This answer also seems to suggest that even code that that doesn't share any files should be in the same repository if it is part of the same project.</p>

<p>At one point in time, this repository became very big due to the nature of the files in it (Many textures and sound files that were needed as part of the Unity project this repo is for), and our solution at the time was to create a submodule to place all assets into while keeping the core project in the main repo.</p>

<p>This worked for a while, but now I have reached the limit again on the main repo, and digging into it (Thanks to the script provided in this answer: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13403069/how-to-find-out-which-files-take-up-the-most-space-in-git-repo"">How to find out which files take up the most space in git repo?</a>), I found out that the reason for this was that all of the files that we have moved to the submodule still have their history intact in the main repo.</p>

<p>I then found out about The BFG (<a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/</a>) that I could use to rewrite the history of my repo and remove the large entries in it by using <code>bfg --delete-folders</code>, then running <code>git gc</code> as instructed in the Usage segment of The BFG page.</p>

<p>Running <code>git count-objects -v</code> afterwards seems to suggest that this had worked, with my repo dropping from a 1.9gb size-pack to under 300mb.
And running the script linked above that finds the heaviest entries in the repo no longer finds any of the problem files that were moved to the submodule.</p>

<p>My problem is that despite all that, when I try to push the cleaned repo back to Bitbucket, it fails under the same claim that the repo had exceeded the 2GB size limit and can no longer accept any pushes.
If it can't accept the push that's supposed to clean it up, then how exactly am I expected to do that?
Any ideas what I'm missing?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

When I discovered the error, I proceeded to remove it and pushed that commit as well.</p>

<p>After that I realised the git history still had those files. On my local machine I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch sites/default' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
git prune
rm -rf .git/refs/original/
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
</code></pre>

<p>After that, I cloned this into a new local repo using:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --no-hardlinks file://path/to/old-repo new-repo
</code></pre>

<p>which gave me a “clean” repository, with the history rewritten to remove the target folder. 
After that I changed the origin of the new repository to my bitbucket repo and force pushed the changes using:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master --force
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>git push origin development --force
</code></pre>

<p>Even though the commits are removed from history, and examining the source on bitbucket does not show those files at all, the repository size is still 5gb. Since I could not find a way to remove those files, I chose to create a new repository on bitbucket and pushed up my new local repository to it.</p>

<p>If another developer who is working on the same project changes his git remote to point to this new repository and does a git pull, will the files on his machine be the same as the new repository?</p>

My project has a submodule that needs to be checked out during the build process. The top level git repository that I'm using is working fine.

<p>However, when Jenkins builds the project it pulls down the top level repository and fails during the submodule. Jenkins is building this using the EC2 plugin so it's built on a slave box that is started up on demand. I've tried to execute git manually on the box, but it fails the same way. I don't fully understand how the ssh key gets pushed onto the box, but I don't understand how to debug this. Why does this work for one module, but fails for the submodule?</p>

I've got two release branches that have changed due to UAT/QA not being able to properly test the changes in time for the Production release schedule. Basically, they rejected some of my development work and accepted some others from a more high priority project. Luckily, I've placed my code in various feature branches. I now know not to merge any of my feature branches until they accept the work. A partial list of these branches is shown below.</p>
<p>The first time they rejected features, I removed the release/2104 (2021 April) branch and then recreated it. This worked fairly easily, as I only had one or two feature branches to merge. I think I had to make a special patch branch to make sure some of my changes got added to the release. I'm not sure if this was the best approach. I'm fairly certain that it has screwed up the merge history for this branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>release/2103
<ul>
<li>feature/jjwalte-DA-44948</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>release/2104
<ul>
<li>feature/jjwalte-DA-45102</li>
<li>feature/jjwalte-DA-45102-2 (special path branch)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>release/2105
<ul>
<li>feature/jjwalte-DA-44971</li>
<li>feature/jjwalte-DA-45008</li>
<li>and several others...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward to the release/2105, I'm all mixed up. I'm not sure if I can rely on the merge history anymore. I was thinking that the best approach might be to rename the current release/2105 branch to release/2105-old (local and remote) and then create a new release/2105 branch from release/2104. We don't have a big team (2 or 3 people max), so it should be simple to get everyone to rename it locally.</p>
<p>Note, I've got about 9 branches that are supposed to go out with release/2105 branch release. Some of my branches were branched off of release/2104 and others were branched off of release/2105. I think this is one of my biggest problems. What do you think is the best approach for this mess?</p>
<p>My current plan for release/2105:</p>
<p>So, first will be rename:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -m release/2105 release/2105-old
git checkout release/2105-old
</code></pre>
<p>Then delete the remote:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin :release/2105
</code></pre>
<p>Then set tracking:</p>
<pre><code>git push --set-upstream origin release/2105-old
</code></pre>
<p>Then I'll create a new 2105 branch off of the 2104 branch.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout release/2104

git checkout -b release/2105
git push --set-upstream origin release/2105
</code></pre>
<p>Then... I'm going to try to use SourceTree (app) to &quot;Cherry Pick&quot; various commits (50+) for the new release/2105 branch.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if all goes well... I'll have a release/2105 branch
with just the tickets/commits I need for the release.</p>

<p>I am currently using git lfs to track png files and my available online storage is running out. As a solution, I'd like to store png files exclusively on the origin remote.

<p>The above configuration is functional as images are pushed to git lfs. Unfortunately the images continue to be pushed to <em>both</em> remotes (origin + cloud). I expect the pointer file on the cloud remote, but no png. </p>

<p>I suspect my lfsurl is incorrect and git lfs is falling back to the default url for each remote, but I see no errors or warnings. Are there tools/logs to troubleshoot?</p>

The webhooks are not adequate to solve my issue, so I am hoping git hooks will work. Since I don't imagine they will work server-side, the git hook should be propagated to each checkout on each developers machine. (I know this might be an issue since its normally a local file, but I can hopefully solve it using information from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/427207/1561176"">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>I want to create a git hook that will push changes to staging branches.</strong></p>

<p>Meaning, if I am a user named <code>bob</code> and I want to push to <code>production/master</code>, instead of it pushing to the <code>production/master</code> branch it will push to a staging branch like <code>staging/master/bob</code>. Same for another user <code>roy</code> who pushes to <code>production/master</code> it will go to <code>staging/master/roy</code>. And the same for any production branch. So <code>edd</code> pushing to <code>production/2.0</code> would push to <code>staging/2.0/edd</code>.</p>

<p>I have tried the pre-commit hook, but I can't find a way to direct the target of the push. I know this is possible.</p>

<p>I tried using <code>GIT_WORK_TREE</code>, and I couldn't seem to get it to work.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>The whole process should be seamless for <code>bob</code> the developer. He should pull from the master and push to the master. (or whatever branch he is working on) and the process will happen in the background. It will push his changes to a staging branch, which will then undergo a CI process, and if successful will be pushed into the main branch. This is the solution that I need.</p>

<p>So, we came up with an idea about <strong>removing <code>.gitignore</code> on vendor folder</strong>, doing <code>composer update</code> on our local computers, pushing everything to repository and deploying it via <code>FTP</code> to our production server. (We use <code>DeployHQ</code> for doing Repository->Production transfer.)</p>

<p>However, right now my local project folder size is 100MB and <code>Bitbucket</code> repository size is only 20MB. My local vendor folder is around 90MB, in repository, it is just few megabytes.</p>

<p>When checking, I came across those values on <code>Bitbucket</code> repository:</p>

<pre><code>vendor / doctrine /
    annotations
        cache → 89493d2c6e [89493d2c6e]
        collections → 3db3ab843f [3db3ab843f]
        common → c4255b9fbd [c4255b9fbd]
        dbal → 3253f7a1c1 [3253f7a1c1]
        inflector → 8b4b3ccec7 [8b4b3ccec7]
        lexer → bc0e1f0cc2 [bc0e1f0cc2]
</code></pre>

<p>In my local vendor folder, I see Doctrine's classes and PHP files.</p>

<p>So I would like to ask few things;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is this happening and what does those annotations means? (Can we relate them to symlinks? e.g Git knows it is Doctrine, so it symlinks to Doctrine's repository, and will download those files from Doctrine's repository on <code>git pull</code>?)</p></li>
<li><p>Can we safely replace our 90MB of vendor folder in production with 5MB vendor folder on our git repository? (By doing git pull on production, or copying repository folder via FTP to production.)</p></li>
<li><p>How do you deal with vendor folder yourself? Keeping it on <code>.gitignore</code> and doing composer update commands via SSH on production, or pushing them to your git repository and push your repository into production server? Also, which one is better?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Ps. Neither git or composer is installed on production server.</p>

<p>Ps. Our upload speed is very low and uploading 90MB will take a rougly a hour. Let me also note this, because we look for the quickest alternatives. </p>

<p>My team has two repos:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Bitbucket repo under active development, with a long commit history.</li>
<li>A newer Github repo, under development by another team, which was created a month or so ago. Instead of forking the Bitbucket repo, for some reason <em>most of</em> the files from the Bitbucket repo were just copied and pushed to Github without the history from Bitbucket.</li>
</ul>

<p>Until we retire Bitbucket, I want to be able to merge changes from Bitbucket over to Github. I've just finished doing this for the first time, so now the newer repo references the history of the older one.</p>

<p>The merge was successful on my machine, but I can't push it to Github because Github won't accept files > 100MB. The hilarious part is that I <strong>don't need</strong> the offending large file, and in fact <em>it was deleted</em> just after I merged <code>Bitbucket/develop</code> into <code>Github/develop</code>. Doesn't matter that it's no longer present in <code>HEAD</code>, it's in the history, so it gets pushed to Github.</p>

<h2>Solution?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Purge the offending file from our Bitbucket repo's history (<a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Force push</strong> all of the affected branches up to Bitbucket.</li>
<li>Re-run the merge from Bitbucket to Github.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a pretty risky prospect. It'll mean everyone working on the old Bitbucket repo will need to push all of their work so far up to Bitbucket. I'll then do the purge. ​<em>Then once I'm done they will have to presumably delete their entire local clone, and re-get it</em>​. If they do any work in the meantime, they'll have to re-apply their commits on top of the new history.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>Are there any alternatives which I'm not considering?
Can I somehow purge the offending file from the newer repo's history while still maintaining the ability to merge from one repo to the other easily?</p>

brief overview, and then show in detail everything I've tried and my
questions as to why they don't work and what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I'm trying to setup a Build Job on Hudson for source code on a private
repository on BitBucket. There are a lot of similar questions on Stack
Overflow, but for various reasons none of them address my needs.</p>

<p>I would like to access it using https instead of ssh, but there
seems no way forward accessing it in Hudson with https, and everyone
on the web seems sold on ssh. So I have tried to make it work with
ssh, but in vain.</p>

<p>
So, my central question is:<br /> <b><i>How can I access a private
BitBucket repository in Hudson?</i></b>
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><p></p>

<ul>
<li><i>I realize Jenkins is better, but I'm working with
an established Hudson Server. Please, no advice about switching to
Jenkins.<br />I included Jenkins in the title and as a tag because more likely than not any solution will be applicable to both.
</i></li>
<li><i>Due to running into several dead-ends, I also ask a couple of ""sub-questions"" that elaborate on the core question above
-- extra gratitude if you can enlighten me on them.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>I use the Git plugin for Hudson, and configure it as follows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9jItL.png"" alt=""Git Configuration""></p>

<p>Since this is a private repository, it needs authentication somehow.  So of course, the build failed.  Here are the relevant parts of the stack trace:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: Error cloning remote repo 'origin' 
hudson.plugins.git.GitException:
Could not clone https://TJamesBoone@bitbucket.org/OtherUser/projectname.git
Caused by: hudson.plugins.git.GitException:
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException:
https://TJamesBoone@bitbucket.org/OtherUser/projectname.git: not authorized
</code></pre>

<p><p><b>Question:</b> <i>Why does the Git Plugin for Hudson not have a place in the project configuration for authentication for private repositories?  After all, the SVN plugin can deal with authentication.  Is there a good reason?</i></p>

<h2>Things I Tried</h2>

<p>I reconfigured the project to use the ssh url instead of the https url:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQKN1.png"" alt=""Git Config with ssh url""></p>

<p>I then created a ssh key using <b><a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git#SetupSSHforGit-Step4.Createaconfigfile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a></b> from Atlassian.  I then added the ssh key to the project on BitBucket.</p>

<p>I tried building again, and got this stack trace (relevant parts):</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: Error cloning remote repo 'origin' 
hudson.plugins.git.GitException:
Could not clone git@bitbucket.org:OtherUser/projectname.git
Caused by: hudson.plugins.git.GitException:
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException:

UnknownHostKey: bitbucket.org. RSA key fingerprint is
97:8c:1b:f2:6f:14:6b:5c:3b:ec:aa:46:46:74:7c:40
</code></pre>

<p>I then figured I should try to configure Hudson with the two ssh plugins that were available, the Publish Over SSH plugin and the SSH plugin (which I learned about <b><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6515039/permission-denied-publickey-when-setting-up-jenkins/8143432#8143432"">here</a></b>).</p>

<p>But I can't figure out how to use them.  First, I assume I don't need the Publish Over SSH plugin, because I'm not trying to publish, I'm just trying to pull.  Secondly, the SSH plugin won't work for me.  I've tried doing this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mlOzH.png"" alt=""SSH Sites Config""></p>

<p>But the problem here is that it can't connect.  Furthermore, it wants a port number, and if I enter in nothing, 22 is used as a default.  I have no idea what to do with it.</p>

<p><p><b>Question:</b> <i>Do I even need to configure an SSH site in order to successfully put from this private BitBucket repository?</i></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><p>
<b><i>How can I access a private
BitBucket repository in Hudson?</i></b></p>

<p>In my Hudson build, I need to be able to pull from this private BitBucket repository.  I can't seem to make it work with ssh, and I don't even know if using https is possible as there's no place for me to put in a password.  If someone can help me either way, I'll be happy.</p>

But just recently within the last month I started using Netbeans 11. </p>

<p>I started a new project where some developers use MACs, some Windows, and I think one uses Linux.<br>
We all use different editors. I am the only Netbeans user. </p>

<p>We have a git/bitbucket repo that we all work together on. </p>

<p>The windows users such as myself use Source tree for Git/bitbucket/repo file management.<br>
I am being told that Netbeans 11 is causing a problem for myself (and the team). </p>

<p>After researching the issue, I personally think it is the global git/bitbucket repo settings.<br>
But the problem has happened several times to me since starting the project on 08/01. (And at least one other developer said it used to happen to him until he switched from one non-Netbeans editor to another. I am not quite clear if it has happened again lately to him or not.)  </p>

<p>When I go to commit and push my changes through Source tree I see a list of files that other developers have edited/committed/pushed and I pulled in my staging area (unstaged files) as if I had changed them which I have not.<br>
The changes are the exact same changes as the original editor/developer made. So there is nothing new—no new apparent changes—not even a slip of the keyboard on my part and an additional blank line or whatever. I don’t even recall opening said files.  </p>

<p>So after researching this online I see that others have had similar issues.<br>
While Netbeans was never mentioned as the culprit in these online posts, I wanted to ask here as an Atlassian developer for Source tree pointed the finger at git/bitbucket global settings. </p>

<p>What would you suggest I say to the members of my team who are suggesting that I need to either make a change to the way Netbeans works to stop this or use a new editor?<br>
I prefer Netbeans. So I don’t want to change editors. I've used it for years and never had this problem before. </p>

<p>The project, if it matters, is a PHP, Slim framework project with some Javascript/JQuery files.<br>
I have found this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15958446/sourcetree-app-says-uncommitted-changes-even-for-newly-cloned-repository-what"">Stackoverflow</a> and <a href=""https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/sourcetree-shows-unstaged-files-of-files-I-did-not-change/qaq-p/329327"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Git/Atlassian</a> help articles that I think speak to my personal opinion on what is causing this.<br>

My assumption was that a rollback would mean creating a <code>rollback</code> branch before merging the <code>feature</code> topic branch and if we require, we can rollback via the <code>rollback</code> PR. However this doesn't work as I thought.</p>

<p><strong>Create rollback branch:</strong></p>

<p><code>git checkout 6af89ed -b rollback-prod</code></p>

<p><strong>Merge Feature branch:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rollback:</strong></p>

<pre><code># production branch

<p>I'd like to make it clear that the <code>rollback</code> needs to be created in advance so that Ops do not have to touch the command-line in the event of a rollback..assuming this is possible, perhaps not.</p>

It's so close to the limit that I'm scared anymore commit operation involving binary files will tip the size to over 2GB, and hence the commit will fail and unable to proceed.</p>

<p>Now, how to best go by to reduce the bigsize repo size?</p>

<p>I'm thinking about using the <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-bfg-to-migrate-a-repo-to-git-lfs-834233484.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LFS feature</a>, but then, there is a 1GB limit on the LFS space, which I afraid will not be sufficient for the usage of this repo ( as the majority of the repo size is coming from the binary files that I want to store in LFS).</p>

<p>So I'm thinking about just removing all the binary files ( I don't mind losing them from source control, as I have them on my local drive) from the repo and the history, how to best do this, considering the current size of my bigsize repo?</p>

<p>The attack plan that I have:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that for all the branches on the  bigsize repo ( yes, I've more than one branch on this gigantic repo), I've remove all of the binary files ( by submitting a commit that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11451731/3834"">specifies <code>*.dll</code> in gitignore and use <code>git rm -rf -cached</code> command</a>) . This is needed because ""<a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">By default the BFG doesn't modify the contents of your latest commit on your master (or 'HEAD') branch, even though it will clean all the commits before it.</a>""</li>
<li>Then use BFG <a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">delete-files command</a> to ""rewrite the history"" so that the repo size will be reduced. </li>
</ol>

<p>Does the approach work for a repo that is very closed to 2GB? I afraid that at step 1, when I use <code>git rm</code>, it will add to the history and push the repo size to over 2GB, and hence fail. </p>

<p><strong>Important details:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I'm the sole author of the repository</li>
<li>Now I am multiple active branches. Throughout the history there are multiple branches that are merged into the main branch</li>
<li>I don't use the repo for discussions or code reviews, and not even tags. I just use it as a single branch, with occasional branching and merging</li>

So I'm looking for some other alternatives, one possible way I was thinking of was to ask the remote for the latest version SHA and compare it with the latest version SHA that the local copy knows, if they match I don't need to run pull command and if they don't match then I need to run the git pull command.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can run <code>git rev-parse master</code> on the remote repository?</p>

<p>You can get more background about my problem <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19374975/how-to-make-my-local-git-copy-always-at-its-latest-version-automatically"">here</a></p>

<p>git diff shows me this instead:</p>

<p>I've tried couple different editors (Eclipse, Gedit), but the outcome is the same. My question is: why does git sees a tab as 8 spaces instead of 4? How do I fix this?</p>

<p>I've tried this:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global core.pager 'less -x4'
</code></pre>

<p>So now the tab size in <code>git diff</code> is correct, but when I push it to remote repository (Bitbucket), it still shows as 8 spaces instead of 4. I don't understand. When I worked on windows everything was fine, but now that I've switched to Ubuntu I have this problem.</p>

<p>How to sync the ""shadow"" repository with the main repository so that the main repository does not know that this is happening?</p>

<ul>
<li>I cannot merge with a git command, since this will reveal what I really have done.</li>
<li>I could copy and paste all files, but that would visible in git that I have deleted all files and replaced with new files with the same name. That does not look good.</li>
<li>My client is using bitbucket. I could give the other developer my bitbucket login, but I would want to avoid to do that.</li>
<li>What actually work, is that I can open a file in the main repository, delete the content and then paste in the updated code. Then I could commit and it would look is if I had done the work directly in the main repository. But this is time-consuming (and time is something I do not have too much of).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a different way that I could ""secretly"" copy the content of files from the shadow repository to the main repository? Is there a linux/osx-command I could use that replaces the content of a file without deleting and recreating the file (which I then could use recursively)? Is there a git-command that make this possible without leaving a trail of evidence of what I have actually done?</p>

I made some progress with generating Oauth2 access tokens for that purpose. My script looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>consumer_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
consumer_secret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

oauth2_return_str=$(curl -X POST https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -u ""${consumer_key}:${consumer_secret}"" -d grant_type=client_credentials 2&gt;/dev/null)
oauth2_token=$(echo $oauth2_return_str | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|["",]||g')

echo $oauth2_token
</code></pre>

<p>There is a <code>clone</code> one liner possible:</p>

<pre><code>git clone ""https://x-token-auth:$(curl -k -X POST https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -u ""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"" -d grant_type=client_credentials | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|["",]||g')@bitbucket.org/USER/REPO.git""
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway instead of rewriting the <code>config</code> file every hour (the tokens are valid just one hour) I found out that <code>GIT_ASKPASS</code> seems appropriate for that purpose:</p>

<pre><code>GIT_ASKPASS
    If this environment variable is set, then git commands which need to
    acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication)             
    will call this program with a suitable prompt as command line argument 
    and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the core.askpass option 
    in git-config(1).
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness:</p>

<pre><code>core.askPass
    Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively ask for
    a password can be told to use an external program given via the value of 
    this variable. Can be overridden by the GIT_ASKPASS environment 
    variable. If not set, fall back to the value of the SSH_ASKPASS 
    environment variable or, failing that, a simple password prompt. The 
    external program shall be given a suitable prompt as command-line 
    argument and write the password on its STDOUT.
</code></pre>

<p>So I wrote a test script:</p>

<pre><code>GIT_ASKPASS=gen-token.bat
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1

git clone ""https://x-token-auth@bitbucket.org/USER/REPO.git""
</code></pre>

<p>BUT it is still prompting me with the password dialogue. If I then enter a generated token everything works as expected. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Ok git seems a little picky about the environment variables. I cahnged the test script to</p>

<pre><code>GIT_ASKPASS=gen-token.bat git clone ""https://x-token-auth@bitbucket.org/USER/REPO.git""
</code></pre>

<p>and it then worked. <code>git config --global core.askPass /path-to/gen-token.sh</code> makes the sript available globally.</p>

I've been looking through the other posts but I do not seem to be able to apply their solutions.<br>
I think it should be noted that I already have cloned the repository and are now trying to set up a automated sync between the two repositories. </p>

<p>this is the tutorial I've been following <a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.co.il/leonj/2017/01/24/synchronizing-tfs-2015-and-vsts-with-github/#GITHUB_TFS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://blogs.microsoft.co.il/leonj/2017/01/24/synchronizing-tfs-2015-and-vsts-with-github/#GITHUB_TFS</a>
with the difference being that my TFS server is a 2017 and that the git is a bitbucket git repository I'm trying to sync with.</p>

<p>First I pull from </p>

<pre><code>git pull https://$(bitbucketcredentials)@bitbucket.org/path/to/git.git master
</code></pre>

<p>then I try to push to with the following response from my tfs:</p>

<p>When the Bitbucket webhook runs, it receives a 200 response from the production server so I know it is getting through, but there is nothing in the body of the response and there should be either a success message or an error message. Of course the git pull never happens either.</p>

<p>I'm unsure how to continue troubleshooting. The plugin's docs say there should be messages in the debug.log but there aren't. I am suspecting that admin-ajax.php is not even communicating with the API of the plugin but I'm not sure what steps to take to dig deeper.</p>

<p>I use Visual Studio to create a build of an open source CMS. I created a repository for the original CMS build using GitBash. I then cloned the original CMS build and created separate repositories so I could work on my production sites modules/themes (one clone for each site). </p>

<p>I would push those module/theme changes to the clones. If necessary, I would push changes to the original CMS repository (which was rare - I left it untouched unless the open source CMS I use had updates; which were then separately pushed to the clones). </p>

<p>I use Bitbucket for the code storage and am using Sourcetree locally to push.</p>

<p>I've tried looking up the answer, but most of what I have read is a bit muddled. Add to this the changes to the Bitbucket and Sourcetree interfaces in the two years since I created these repositories/clones and I feel a bit lost. I'm worried I might make a mistake, so I came here.</p>

<p>How would I go about reconnecting my Bitbucket repositories (both the original CMS, and the clones) to my local drive? Am I going to have to use GitBash, or can I do this through the Sourcetree interface? And how exactly?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I made a mistake. The original CMS was not pushed to Bitbucket. It just was created on my local drive and then the clones were made from there. How do I reconnect the local clones to that original CMS repository using GitBash?</p>

<p>Why is it that <code>git diff --name-state master</code> shows differences between <code>dev</code> and <code>master</code> and <code>git branch -d dev</code> says <code>dev</code> is not fully merged, but <code>git push</code> and making a pull request on Bitbucket indicate that there are no differences between <code>dev</code> and <code>master</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I ran <code>git checkout master</code> and then <code>git merge dev</code>, and this solved my problem. But I still don't understand why my previous approach ^^ didn't work. Any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<li>Can I resolve it only by myself in some better way of configuring git locally (I mean on my local computer)?</li>

<li>Does something need to be adjusted on the git server (BitBucket)?</li>

<li>clone the repo on local PC</li>
<li>check git LFS is installed : <code>git lfs install</code></li>

<h3>On local</h3>

<ul>
<li>git clone the repo to another dir. Then go to repo-dir</li>

<p>On this occasion, there had been a lot of work done by others, so when I did that, I pulled in 147 commits, so <code>git status</code> showed that I was well ahead of <code>origin</code> (my fork).

The usual trick here is to do <code>git rebase -i</code>, and then edit the last message to <code>squash</code>. I did this.</p>

<p>When I saw how massive the list was, I exited without saving changes. Squashing the two commits into one wasn't really that important, so I abandoned the idea. However, git still ran through the list of commits, redoing all of them, which took a long while.</p>

<p>When I pushed, and then opened a pull request on Bitbucket, Bitbucket tried to apply <em>all</em> of the commits, not just the ones I'd done myself. And since other changes had been made since, this resulted in a bunch of merge conflicts in code I hadn't touched.</p>

<p>Is there any neat way to resolve this? I'm thinking of nuking my fork and reforking (none of my branches contain anything valuable), but perhaps there's something less destructive I could try?</p>

<p>The error makes it seem like because they are all pushing at the same time there is some kind of conflict, but I would think this should only be the case if we're pushing to the same branches?  These are all 3 diff branches.  It seems one branch succeeded but the rest fail, so I think its obvious that the parallel nature of this is causing the issue, but I fail to understand why when its running on different machines, on different branches.</p>

The message is specific to the currently open repository Tab and the url in the message is the same url shown in the Repository Setting for the origin of that repository, which is correct and working.</p>
<p>I suspect there is a setting that can be added to the Repository Settings Config file to fix this and don't believe it has anything to do with the &quot;default browser&quot;.

I have research ways to fully make a backup of a repository. Including all branches, tags, everything! I would like to have it as a restore point if my Bitbucket account would be compromised or if my Bitbucket repositories would, for some reason, disappear.</p>
<p>I have tried different things. But I sense I am not fully understanding what is happening and therefore not able to determine which approach is the correct one and why.</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions covering this subject, so I might have missed the obvious answer :-). However I am not able to fully understand if any of them consider all branches or just the one already checked out. If they consider to backup a remote cloud based repo and not a local version of it.</p>
<p>The main things I have explored is a normal git clone followed by a pull --all. I know now that the --all never will pull branches not already checked out. So here I fail to get all existing remote branches.</p>
<p>The second thing I tried was the git clone --mirror which to some extent is a full copy of the remote repository. I fail to understand what I get on disk after just this command. It is super fast and surely not downloading all content. The size is way under even a normal repository when zipped</p>
<p>So I did a three step rocket.</p>
<ol>
<li>git clone -mirror</li>
<li>git clone &quot;from the mirror&quot; to &quot;local repo&quot;. Then I get a repo with a working tree</li>
<li>git pull --all on the local repo created above in hope to get all remote branches as local branches</li>
</ol>
<p>When done I did a git branch to examine what I got but it still seems like I have more remote branches then local ones.</p>
<p>I apologize if my lack of knowledge confuse things! Which approach shall I use?</p>
<p>I am thinking of one more and that is to do a normal clone. Then get all remote branches to loop them through and do checkout. Would that be a better option?</p>

I can configure git to ensure that commits to the superproject have valid submodule references at the time of pushing them (<code>git config push.recurseSubmodule check</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Can I configure git/BitBucket to ensure that gitlinks referenced by my superproject will always exist in the submodule?</strong></p>
<p>In particular, I am concerned about the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>a developer pushes a submodule commit to a feature branch</li>
<li>a developer pushes a superproject commit that references a commit the submodule feature branch
<ul>
<li><em>the push to the superproject is allowed by the config as the gitlink is currently valid on the remote</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a developer subsequently <em>removes</em> the submodule feature branch without merging it
<ul>
<li><em>the superproject is now broken: it has a gitlink to a commit that does not exist in the remote</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to retain control over what is referenced in the superproject (I don't want to automatically follow a branch on the submodule).</p>
<p>Potential approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there any way with git or BitBucket to enforce that the superproject can only contain submodule gitlinks that are on the submodule master branch?</li>
<li>Is it possible to enforce that any PR merges in the superproject only contain commits where the gitlinks resolve against the submodule master branch?</li>
<li>... or some better approach here that I'm not seeing at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>Side note: I've attempted to go through the process to break the superproject, but it didn't work! I think that this is because the SHA of the feature branch on the remote is not immediately cleaned away (reflog default pruning strategy is to keep 90 days history).</p>

<p>I know how to do the first part local in SourceTree. But how to do the second part in SourceTree? Is it possible? Currently I do a local part in SourceTree. Then But have to switch to command line to make <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> in my remote repo. I connect my server with SSH and type commands.</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong></p>

<p>How to automate an update of a server copy of my remote repo? So that it would be unnecessary to connect the server with SSH in command line and type <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>.</p>

<p>For example, I just push a commit on my local machine and my server automatically fetches and merges changes.</p>

<p><strong>UPD 2:</strong></p>

<p>I have modified and re-asked my question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45228194/how-to-automate-an-update-of-a-server-copy-of-my-remote-repo"">How to automate an update of a server copy of my remote repo?</a></p>

<p>At work we're thinking about using git to manage our customizations to a COTS product we purchased. I'm having a little bit of a hard time figuring out the best way to approach this.</p>

<p>My idea was that we would have three perm branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>master (the default vendor files)</li>
<li>gold (branch of master, our added stuff + customized vendor files, this is the gold source)</li>
<li>development (branch of gold, stuff being developed, duh!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The workflow would go something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>for vendor patches: branch master, update files, merge back into master, rebase gold merging our customizations back into the vendors updated files</li>
<li>for hotfixes (our code): branch gold, fix code, merge back into gold, rebase development</li>
<li>for new features (our code): branch dev, merge back in when ready, merge into gold when we are doing a release</li>
</ul>

<p>So in my testing, I mostly like how it's working, commit history looks good, flow seems ok, but the big problem i think i have is that it requires me to force push after the rebase. for example:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout development
git checkout -b feat-myfeature
*do my thing, commit changes*
git checkout development
git merge feat-myfeature
git push

git checkout gold
git merge development
git push

git checkout master
git checkout -b patch-xxxxx
*update the vendor files, do commits*
git checkout master
git merge patch-xxxxx

git checkout gold
git rebase master
*fix conflicts, adding back our customizations*
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push (error!)
</code></pre>

<p>At this point git tells me I have a divergent history and i either must pull and de-conflict the exact same things i just de-conflicted with the rebase or a force push works too...I think the force push is going to cause me all sorts of headaches that I'm not even aware of and the fact that a pull forces me to fix the same conflicts again makes me think i've make a mistake with my plan somewhere along the way.</p>

<p>Can you guys offer any suggestions to improve this flow?</p>

<p>I had a working folder connected with Bitbucket Repository. And I was working on a branch. The branch was already pushed and exist on Bitcucket remote. I have committed some changes locally, and then while committing one more changes SourceTree hanged and did not respond for half an hour. I will not blame source tree, it was my machine. So had to restart my machine. after that i cannot push any changes and was getting file corrupted error. Then, I <em>deleted</em> the .git folder :(</p>

<p>I was searching for any way to map the local folder with existing git repo, could not find anything. Is it possible or not?</p>
<h3>Plan B</h3>
<p>I can map my existing repository to a new folder and then copy the changed folders to the mapped folder. Not sure, that will work or not? It may work, but i am looking for any other solution better than this or a proper way to do that</p>

<p>Originally I created a new branch off our QA branch</p>

<p>I've been working on that branch, making commits to that branch.  Now I'm ready to PR the branch but first like any good developer, I wanna see if there are latest changes I can grab that have been checked into the QA branch since I first created my branch off the QA branch to make sure my local changes mesh with whatever is latest in QA at the moment.</p>

<p>So...what I think I did though is I ended up merging what's in the <code>master</code> branch into my branch instead of <code>qa</code>.  If I'm right about that (I assume I am..see below, the commands I performed) then I need to back out and do this again but do it right...merge latest from QA and so need to make sure I do that right as well.  I am not used to using bit bucket so I don't know if all I had to do was a pull and it would have auto merged QA into mine or what but I usually switch to the branch I want to pull from, then do a merge into my local branch.  Well I tried a different way this time rather than that and I think I messed up.</p>

<p>Our branch setup (notice the <code>qa</code> branch is the default branch):</p>

<p>From the command line, here is what I did along with my (thought process):</p>

<p>(ok I just pushed my latest changes to my <code>65</code> branch.  I wonder if with BitBucket, I can just do a git pull and it'll pull latest from the <code>qa</code> branch without having to switch and do a merge from the <code>qa</code> branch into <code>65</code>?...hmm lets try it)</p>

<p><strong>In SourceTree</strong>
We have 4 main branches</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>_dev</strong> (from which we create feature-branches, each feature branch corresponds to a JIRA task)</li>
<li><strong>_qa</strong> (to which we merge feature-branches once features are ready and code reviewed on _dev)</li>
<li><strong>_next-release</strong> (to which we merge the feature branch when a feature is approved by QA)</li>
<li><strong>master</strong> (to which we merge the entire <strong>_next-release</strong> branch when the sprint is over, thereby merging only the approved features)</li>
</ol>

<p>We also have <strong>version branches</strong> to which we merge the master branch when a version is released (we do this to make sure we can return to that branch and make adjustments if necessary as our product is an installable one)</p>

<p>Our problematic scenario is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dev1 creates feature1 (branch from _dev)</li>
<li>Dev1 merges feature1 to _dev (let's say it's waiting for code review at this point)</li>
<li>Dev1 creates and starts working on feature2 (branch from _dev again)</li>
<li>Dev1 merges feature2 into _dev and passes code review.</li>
<li>Dev1 attempts to merge feature2 to _qa</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: both feature1 and feature2 seem to merge into QA, even though feature1 is not ready yet.</p>

<p>We merge by right clicking the branch and picking ""merge featureX into current branch""</p>

<p>Please note we have 4 environments that (should) reflect each branch so QA have a place to check features.</p>

<p><strong>Why</strong> are features being merged together with features we did not want to merge?</p>

<p><strong>What</strong> is the common workflow that will allow merging only validated features into a version while allowing QA an environment to check features and allow for a clean history that will reflect each feature's lifecycle - dev -> QA -> release -> version</p>

<p>I assumed the git reset would revers everything from the accidental commit, but after checking bitbucket's list of git lfs files, it seems all the lfs tracked files from the accidental commit were pushed to lfs in origin. These files do not exist if I look through the source in bitbucket.</p>

<p>So I tried doing <code>git lfs prune</code> which appeared to delete an amount of files that looks to be about the amount that was accidentally commited, then <code>git lfs push origin master</code>. Checked bitbucket's list of git lfs files again, but those files are still there and nothing's changed in origin. </p>

<p>What have I done wrong?</p>

develop      \---2---/

<p>but commits 3 onwards were done within the develop branch. Doing <code>git checkout master</code> and <code>git checkout develop</code> showed this to be true.</p>

<p>Commit 1, isn't actually the first commit in my repo, its the last commit I made on 'master'</p>

<p>Thanks to SimoneDemoGentili for pointing out my incorrect use of <code>git checkout develop</code></p>

<p>P.S.: Commits 1 and 2 are also a mystery to me being that commit 2 is actually an amendment of commit 1 (as far I thought, I used this <a href=""http://nathanhoad.net/git-amend-your-last-commit"" rel=""nofollow"">advice</a>)</p>

<p>The twist is that I am trying to clone a repository from Stash, an application from Atlassian like git-hub that our company uses for storing its git repositories.  After I enter my public key into Stash, I use Git Bash to try to clone a repository from there with the ssh address provided me by the system.  This is what results:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://git@stash.mycompany.com:7999/teamproject/gitrepo.git

have no guarantee that the server is the computer you
think it is.

<p>Since I'm not using putty to try to connect, I tried the solution of connecting to the server with ssh:</p>

ssh: stash.mycompany.com:7999/teamproject/gitrepo.git: no address associated with name

<p>If I tried shortening down the address that ssh can recognize, I get a different fingerprint than what git is rejecting:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh ssh://git@stash.mycompany.com
The authenticity of host 'stash.mycompany.com (10.XX.XXX.XX)' can't be established.

<p>and still get the same error as i shared above.</p>

<p>3) there was a SO question where solution talked, that the key might not be created right. 
Now i have using the same key for my normal development &amp; been using it fine for a year &amp; have the pub added to my bitbucket repo and it works fine. its our own repo(not git hub) i normally work fine with the key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. So i created RSA private key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa file into a temp directory and using the same for the config server APP.</p>

<p>4) in the known hosts file, there are about 7 entries 1 of them is the bitbucket server. and its ssh-rsa.</p>

<p>was wondering if there a step-by-step guide or some sample someone can help me with please ?</p>

<p>Trying to squash these commits resulted in <code>0942142</code>, which is basically empty. What I mean is if I try and view that commit it shows no files changed, which could be normal for a ""merge"" commit - I don't know.</p>

<p>PS: This is a private repo (for now), so nobody has pulled any of these changes (yet).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> TheBuzzSaw's answer below is correct for squashing every commit since <code>0a1837e</code>. I wanted to just squash those three commits and keep the rest of the history, however (the screenshot is a mockup - not representative of actual changes). So I had to do this:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~7
git cherry-pick -n 0a1837e..c265825

<p>I've had two times now that I needed to resolve a merge.
The docs at bitbucket, where we are hosting the repo, say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To resolve these kinds of conflicts you pull the changes to your local
  repository and resolve them there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is the correct procedure?</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull the developer's pull request locally, fix the issue, and then push it back to <code>origin</code></li>
<li>Check out the destination (<code>development</code>) locally, merge there and do not care about the branch originating the PR?</li>
</ul>

<p>The first fixes the problem completely, as our remote developer needs to update his own branch afterwards - but feels a bit ""intrusive"", as I am changing his own personal feature branch.</p>

<p>The latter feels right, but doesn't completely fix the issue. If the remote developer is not diligent enough, he may still drag the conflict into the next PR.</p>

<p>The third of course is to reject the PR altogether, which is the cleanest probably, and have the remote dev fix the issue. He may not always be able to do so though, that's why I am in charge of approving...Also this is slow, and may require a day of delay due to time zone differences.</p>

<p>The problem I am seeing is that if I run the script manually, it works just fine.

If I cd into the directory after the script exits, I am able to run git log (and other git commands).  </p>

<p>Things I tried to troubleshoot are 
1. Permissions issues (running it as root), so I am not seeing any permissions issues.
2. troubleshooting it with bash -xv and until that point everything looks good.

<p>In my project pull request on bitbucket are verified by Jenkins builds. Building and testing takes about 50 minutes. This works quite nicely.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>There are some changes which do not have impact on working code (front-end related). So if pull request touches only one of two sub-directories there is no point to do build and running tests. The aim is to save time (less time to release minor not harmful changes) and resources (do not occupy build machine for useless jobs).</p>

<p>I do not want to split project (one of possible solutions), since quite often changes in front-end require changes in actual back-end code, so in such case testing is required.</p>

<h2>Possible solution</h2>

<p>I found the way to stop Jenkins build with a success on first step which fetches new code.</p>

<p>Problem is how to ask git if branch (change) touches only two sub-directories. This probably will require something like this:</p>

<pre><code>git diff master...featureBranch  &lt;some other options&gt;

<p>Before I ask my question, I would like to inform you that I'm not familiar with Git and used to work with Subversion for years. For this project I want to use Git, because ZF2 is using this and after some reading the suggestion is to prefer Git over Subversion.</p>

<p>The project is based on Zend Framework 2. ZF2 uses a git repository. I don't remember exactly, but when I started the project I just ""cloned"" the zf2 skeleton application into my webfolder and then I started writing my own modules.</p>

<p>My actual question is: How can I use my own (private) git repository (hosted on bitbucket.org) without interfering with the git repo zf2 uses? </p>

<p>I think I could follow one of these approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I just commit everything (including all the zf2 files) to my own repository. Every once in a while I update zf2 to a newer version. Obviously the files then have changed, and I commit this to my own repository. If I want to do this, I think I should delete the .git folder in the root directory of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>I commit only the three folders that actually get changed by me, and I ignore the rest (using .gitignore?). So my commits would only contain my own modules, configuration and public files. The zf2 files are not even present in my repository.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Somehow both of these approaches seem weird to me and it seems to me that I am thinking to much in a Subversion way.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there anyone who can tell me what would be the best way to do this? </li>
<li>What is the best way to keep zf2 up to date if I have the project in my own repository?</li>
</ul>

The corresponding <a href=""https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/CocoaPods+Repositories#CocoaPodsRepositories-RemoteRepositories"" rel=""nofollow"">docs of Artifactory</a> say I have to install the ""Stash Archive Plugin"". I installed the ""Bitbucket Server Archive Plugin"". The connection test when setting up the remote repository in Artifactory is successful. But then when I want to add the repository as a Cocoapods-art repository: </p>

<pre><code>pod repo-art add repoArtSpecs http://artifactoryURL:port/artifactory/api/pods/artSpecs
</code></pre>

<p>It fails -> 404. So I started investigating:</p>

<p>First I checked the Logs, there I found the command that lets repo-art fail:</p>

<pre><code>someID|1|REQUEST|someIP|anonymous|GET|/api/pods/artSpecs/index/fetchIndex|HTTP/1.1|404|0
</code></pre>

<p>Good, so I start <strong>Postman</strong> to check exactly this GET request for more information. The request looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>GET http://artifactoryURL:port/artifactory/api/pods/artSpecs/index/fetchIndex
</code></pre>

<p>and the response looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""status"": 404,
      ""message"": ""Remote git refs at 'http://bitbucketURL:port/Specs.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack' not found""
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>From there I continue, check the git docs and see that the handshake for a fetch operation takes two HTTP requests. The first one is exactly the one I get the error on. So I start trying to get this GET request to work:</p>

<pre><code>GET http://bitbucketURL:port/Specs.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
</code></pre>

<p>No success, the response is the html of the error site of Bitbucket. So I compared it to the same request with the public cocoapods Specs repository:</p>

<pre><code>GET https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this works perfect and I get all the refs.</p>

<p>So is there anything known with Bitbucket Server that I do not know, that I need to configure, etc.?</p>

We both use the same admin account on our server, which we access via ssh. We want to be able to use our own Bitbucket accounts to manage Git repo on the server, but we don't know how to do this.

In short I need to reapply changes I already applied each time I rebase. I have recreated the problem using the steps below. Its a simplified version but the outcome was the same.</p>

<ol>
<li>Developer A creates a git repo and adds a <code>contributors.txt</code> to <code>master</code>, commits and pushes. Now <code>master</code> has a <code>contributors.txt</code> file. The contents of the file is 
<code>
     Developer A
</code></li>
<li>Developer A creates <code>branch-a</code> from <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Developer B creates <code>branch-b</code> from <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Developer A appends the contributors file in <code>branch-a</code> so it looks like.
<code>
     Developer A
     Developer A2
</code></li>
<li>Developer B appends the contributors file in <code>branch-b</code> so it looks like
<code>
     Developer A
     Developer B
</code></li>
<li>Developer A commits and pushes the changes to remote <code>branch-a</code></li>
<li>Developer B commits and pushes the changes to remote <code>branch-b</code>.</li>
<li>Developer A merges <code>branch-a</code> with <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Developer B checks out master and pulls so the local master gets updated with the changes applied by the merge mentioned in step 8 above.</li>
<li>Developer B checks out <code>branch-b</code> and does <code>git rebase master</code></li>
<li>Developer B gets a merge conflict.</li>
<li>Developer B fixes the merge conflict so the file now looks like
<code>
     Developer A
     Developer A2
     Developer B
</code></li>
<li>Developer B does <code>git add</code> to add the fixed conflict and runs <code>git rebase --continue</code>. All goes well.</li>
<li>Developer B pulls <code>branch-b</code> since now the local and remote <code>branch-b</code> has diverged they need to be merged. (Needs to set-upstream before pull)</li>
<li>Developer B resolves merge conflict, now the local <code>branch-b</code> has the changes from master and can be pushed to remote.</li>
<li>Developer B pushes <code>branch-b</code> to remote. using <code>git push origin branch-b</code>. All goes well.</li>
<li>Developer B creates a new file in <code>branch-b</code> and commits.</li>
<li>Developer B then does

<ul>
<li><code>git checkout master</code></li>
<li><code>git pull</code> (master is up to date since it has not changed since last pull i.e. Step 9)</li>
<li><code>git checkout branch-b</code></li>
<li><code>git rebase master</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When <code>git rebase master</code> is executed, git asks developer B to resolve the same conflicts all over again. Why does this happen? Shouldn't the already applied changes be known and not asked to be applied again?</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I can use merge instead of rebase to overcome this problem. But it seems like I am using rebase incorrectly. Please let me know what I am doing wrong</p>

My Professor gave us few tasks. So I created two public repos <code>Task1</code> and <code>Task2</code> on github and normally I have done these tasks couple of days before the deadline.</p>

<p>And then he told us that we should have one private repo and there store all tasks and additional gave one more task. So I created new repo <code>FinalVersion</code> on Bitbucket and I cloned all my previous repos there, additionally I have done the newest task and pushed my all previous task and the new one to the brand new repo. And then my professor told us that he will check also our commits which I lose when pushed all staff on bitbucket.</p>

<p><strong><em>Goal</em></strong>: take all commits history from these two repos <code>Task1</code> and <code>Task2</code> and put it at the beginning of <code>FinalVersion</code></p>

<p>I searched it on google but found only example: <code>sb clone repo 1:1 using -mirror</code> option. I thought that I can copy the final version somewhere and then try use <code>-mirror</code> option on <code>Task1</code> and <code>Task2</code> and then do <code>rebease</code> the <code>FinalVersion</code> and put it on the latest master node.</p>

<p>The issue I'm getting is that the <code>git ftp init</code> seems to be uploading the <code>src</code> folder, and not the contents of the <code>build</code> one which is created during the <code>gulp</code> step.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <code>--syncroot</code> does seem to be a partial fix. Meaning it does try to upload the <code>build</code> directory now. However, the problem at this point is that <code>git ftp</code> only seems to be syncing tracked files.</p>

<p>Because the files in the <code>build</code> folder are created during the pipeline build, that does not apply to those.</p>

<p>I have tried to add a file named <code>.git-ftp-include</code>, which as described should transfer untracked files. Sadly, I haven't been successful in deploying my code.</p>

<p><code>.git-ftp-include</code> file contents:
    build/index.html:/src/index.html</p>

<p>Which basically says: upload <code>index.html</code> from the <code>build</code> syncroot whenever the <code>index.html</code> in the <code>src</code> directory is changed.</p>

<p>I work as part of a team of 5 developers. One of our biggest clients has a huge site built in Wordpress with lots and lots going on.</p>

<p>We use Bitbucket for our repos and SourceTree to handle all our commits and check-ins. </p>

<p>We often have jobs that are quite small, that don't get signed off at the same time. E.g:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Job one.</strong> Project manager 1 needs an update to the sidebar on page X</li>
<li><strong>Job two.</strong> Project manager 2 wants to change the button on page Y to red</li>
</ul>

<p>Often these jobs will be done by different developers, but will use the <em>same files</em>. We will push our commits, when ready, to our <code>demo</code> branch and then await sign off. Sometimes, Project Manager doesn't sign off <strong>Job One</strong> for a few weeks. However in that time, <strong>Job Two</strong> needs to go live.</p>

<p>The issue we keep having is that because our <code>demo</code> branch (and our corresponding <code>demo</code> site) have the work for both <strong>Job One</strong> and <strong>Job Two</strong> on it, we can't just merge our <code>demo</code> branch into <code>live</code> branch (and live site). </p>

<p>How do you guys manage this? What's the best way to sort through multiple jobs working together? We have small jobs, large jobs, medium jobs all happening on the same site at the same time and we're constantly falling over pushing up things that aren't ready from our <code>demo</code> to <code>live</code> because they haven't been signed off. We merge the branches together and add things that aren't supposed to be there.</p>

<p>Any advice in how this is possible let me know!</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with permissions, because when I'm on my instance via ssh, I can run &quot;git pull&quot; as ec2-user. Also, &quot;git pull&quot; works when I'm the root user.</p>
<p>How can I get it to work? I think it was something to do with permissions.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I did some troubleshooting (thanks for the tips @cyberx86) and found the following:</p>
<p>I was able to execute the update hook on the command line by running <code>php update.php</code> and it worked why I was root, but not when I was ec2-user.  The error log showed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so I ran the command <code>chmod -R 777 .git</code> as the root user.</p>
<p>Now I'm able to pull updates via <code>git pull</code> and <code>php update.php</code> on the command line, but it's not working when I do it through the post-receive hook or when I point my browser to url/update.php.  The error log shows</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Host key verification failed.^M<br />
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this means that whichever user runs the command when it's accessed via a browser doesn't have an ssh key set up, so it looks like the shell command is running, but the remote repository is not letting that user pull.</p>
<p>As per @cyberx86's advice, I checked out the users in /etc/passwd and while there is no PHP user, there is an user named apache: <code>apache:x:48:48:Apache:/var/www:/sbin/nologin</code> and then I ran <code>sudo -u apache php -q update.php</code> and got the following message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could not create directory '/var/www/.ssh'.</p>
<p>The authenticity of host 'bitbucket.org (207.223.240.181)' can't be established.</p>
<p>RSA key fingerprint is REDACTED</p>
<p>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes</p>
<p>Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/var/www/.ssh/known_hosts).</p>
<p>Permission denied (publickey).</p>
<p>fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like it's a matter of setting up a ssh key for the user (presumably apache) that runs the shell script via browser.</p>

<p>Next, I followed the tutorial here <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Reduce+repository+size"">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Reduce+repository+size</a> and tried to delete unused large data.

<p>Repeating the same for 50M resulted in the same. </p>

<p>Does this mean that all the files larger than 50 MB are in the latest commit? In Source code browser in Bitbucket, I looked at folders that contain large data files but those files are not included (successfully ignored).</p>

<p>After reading a lot of documentation around it, I'm pretty sure how I should use <code>git-filter-repo</code>, but I'm missing how I should execute the other steps in a correct way.</p>
<p>This is the method that I came up with, but I would like your advice on if it is the correct way, or if there is something I'm missing.
I'm using bitbucket for my repository, and when I tried it out the bitbucket web interface is very slow and sometimes it fails to list branches etc.</p>
<p>First I create a new empty repo on bitbucket, repo2.
Then I execute the following sequence:</p>
<pre><code>git clone --bare --mirror https://user@bitbucket.com/workspace/repo1
cd repo1
git filter-repo --path &lt;path to remove&gt; --invert-paths
git remote add origin https://user@bitbucket.com/workspace/repo2
git push --mirror
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>git filter-repo</code> will remove the original remote path to origin.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I should use --mirror or something else on clone and push. some documents say that I should use <code>git push -u origin --all</code>, but I guess that some references would be missing after that.</p>
<p>Why is bitbucket so slow in listing my new repo2? It is also listing the size to only be a few kB, but it seem to contain everything I want. Is it just that it takes some time for the servers to update?</p>

Naturally, each of our developers has accounts.  The other day, we added our first submodule to our main repository.  But the process has not been without its hiccups.</p>

<p>Particularly one thing I cannot explain is how I tell git to use the user's account when cloning the submodule.  Assume our internal Bitbucket server is called <code>bitbucket:7990</code> and we clone over <code>http</code>.  Wouldn't the appropriate way to add a submodule's URL be <code>http://git@bitbucket:7990/scm/project/repo.git</code>?</p>

<p>I thought as much, since it worked on most of our machines.  But on one of our developers' machine, git tried to use ""git"" as the account name - obviously failing, as that account doesn't exist on our system.  Why didn't it use the developer's own account to clone?  Like it did on the other developers' machine?</p>

<p>I could not spot a difference in their <code>.git/config</code>.  Eventually, I ended up fixing it by manually inserting their account name into the submodule's URL in their <code>config</code>-file.  But I fear the issue may come up again next time we add another submodule.</p>

<p>Am I handling submodules wrong?  Or is there some trick I am missing?</p>

<p>For the record, I tried replacing the <code>http</code>-cloning to <code>ssh</code>-cloning, but it still tried to log in with the ""git"" account.  My own <code>config</code>-file uses the <code>git</code>-account.  I also tried removing the protocol, but then the <code>:</code> portion of the URL changes meaning, and I do not know how to specify the custom SSH port (as it noted it failed to log in on port 22).</p>

<p>Additionally, we are on Windows, and we are using SmartGIT as our main GUI.  But using the git command directly, the same issue persisted.</p>

<p>I guess things got complicated for me when I started thinking about Eclipse workspaces vs. local git files. I am now very confused on the most efficient way to be syncing between two computers. I am able to do it now, but it's very cumbersome and ALWAYS the project-properties is incorrect about the path to the ActionBarSherlock library.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR - This being said, what is the high level concept for easily pushing and pulling code from BitBucket without dependencies getting broken in the process?</strong></p>

<p>Also, should I have a full copy of my project in my workspace AND in the local git directories? I believe I should as one mirrors the other? Or should I only have 1 physical set of files, in the local git directories, which is logically referenced to from Eclipse (as opposed to having the physical files copied to the workspace itself).</p>

A medium-sized team of experienced developers have been using this bitbucket project sucessfully for about 5 years. </p>

<p>Until yesterday, I was having similar success. However, today i recieved a Jira item with a bug to be fixed. As is usual and recommended, I click the Jira item's link to create a branch and then browse to the branch on bitbucket to check it out or clone it. </p>

<p>However, today, I created the branch in Jira and browsed to the branch in bitbucket to check it out (cloning and checkout seem to both put a local copy of the development branch in a local folder for me, maybe one is checked out and the other checks itself out the first time I make a change).</p>

<p>But, today, although a branch is created by Jira, and i can find an active link in Jira that will browse me to the branch in Jira, I cannot locate that branch in the bitbucket list of branches no matter which of all the available methods for finding a branch I try.</p>

<p>And, whether I clone the branch or check it out, sourcetree downloads, not the branch I want (a copy of development with the new branch name to match the task name in Jira) but rather a copy of the bare repository that is the root of the GIT project in bitbucket.</p>

<p>I have tried this repeatedly today in every way I am able. But I am unable to view the new branch in the BitBucket list of branches, and I can only download the bare repository, not the copy of the most recent development branch.</p>

<p>But I am still unable to clone it, not sure what the issue is. Can someone help.</p>

<p>PS: It does look like a duplicate question but been failing to get it work from the earlier answers from other questions.</p>

This triggers a webhook to my other machine, which initiates a pull from BitBucket.</p>

<pre><code>[my machine]
   \
    +---1.push--&gt; [bitbucket] &lt;---3.pull------+
                       \                       \
                        +--2.webhook--&gt; [other machine]
</code></pre>

<p>However, it is possible for BitBucket to <a href=""https://status.bitbucket.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not be available sometimes</a>. So I also want to be able to push my changes to the other machine directly. My git protocol I use to sync with BitBucket is SSH, and I also have an SSH connection to my other machine. </p>

<p>So this is what I want to accomplish.</p>

<pre><code>[my machine]
   \
    +---push--&gt; [other machine]
</code></pre>

<p>The command to push I use is:</p>

<pre><code>git push ssh://USERNAME@SSH_SERVER_NAME/path/to/remote/repository
</code></pre>

<p>When there's nothing to sync, I get the message <code>Everything up-to-date</code>. OK, nice. But when there is new commit to push, I get an error message (removed some lines for brevity).</p>

<pre><code>! [remote rejected] master -&gt; master (branch is currently checked out)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://USERNAME@SSH_SERVER_NAME/path/to/remote/repository'
</code></pre>

<p>Someone suggested to switch branches, but I'm unsure if I'm doing the right thing here. Switching branches sound weird, because BitBucket doesn't switch branches either, so why should I do this?</p>

<p>The questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I push a change, skipping my normal BitBucket workflow?</li>
<li>Can BitBucket catch up later with the changes? I a pull/push from both machines enough to restore the ""normal"" workflow?</li>
</ol>

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/5787937/883431"">Git status shows files as changed even though contents are the same</a></li>
</ul>

<p>but does not look quite the same. In my case, only a couple of files out of about two thousands are modified. I detected the modification by <code>git status</code> right after <code>git clone</code>. These modified files were originally text files with ascii encoding, but after cloning they were regarded as a binary file, as the <code>file</code> command showed:</p>

<pre><code>norio@machine-original $ file -bi t_pot_2e_fft002.f90
text/plain; charset=us-ascii

norio@machine-new $ file -bi t_pot_2e_fft002.f90
application/octet-stream; charset=binary
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>t_pot_2e_fft002.f90</code> is a file that was found to be modified.</p>

<p>In these modified files, a few but not all of commas <code>,</code>, white spaces <code></code>, and underscores <code>_</code> were replaced with some non-ASCII characters, but I can still read most part of the file by the <code>less</code> command or emacs.</p>

<p>I repeated cloning 6 times into a different local directories, and I saw the modification 2 times. In the other 4 times, there was no modification. In the 2 cases in which files were modified, the files modified were different from one case to another.</p>

<p>I worked on repositories on <code>machine-original</code> and <code>machine-original2</code> (to which I do not have access any more) pushing to and fetching from a remote repository on bitbucket. Now I am cloning this repository on bitbucket to <code>machine-new</code>. The version of git is <code>1.9.1</code> on <code>machine-original</code> and <code>2.14.1</code> on <code>machine-new</code>. (Edit: <code>machine-original</code> runs ubuntu 14.04 and <code>machine-new</code> runs ubuntu 17.10.)</p>

<p>I had <code>core.filemode=true</code> on <code>machine-original</code> until I realize this problem. Then, I changed it to false, but I do not know how to propagate the effect to remote repository -- I did <code>git push</code>, but only got <code>Everything up-to-date</code>.</p>

<p>I do not have the <code>.gitattributes</code> file mentioned in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/10363472/883431"">an answer</a> to one of the questions above.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why these non-reproducible modifications are made upon cloning? Is it safe to keep using a cloned repository if no modification was detected by <code>git status</code> right after <code>git clone</code>? </p>

Running it locally as a developer throws some dangling or unreachable objects, I believe this is a normal thing that happens. But on a fresh <code>git clone</code> there shouldn't be any issues right? So if fsck had errors then we're having a bad time?</p>

Before this I used PC and git and BitBucket worked like a charm, without any errors like this ever happening. </p>

<p>I have simplified the issue so I can reproduce it to you more easily. I have typed just a single space in my file and commited this to bitbucket. After this , when I look at the commit diff on BitBucket on the internet repository, I am getting the diff that completely differs to the actual state of the file (it should just have a single space in it). Here is the diff as displayed on bitbucket:</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/cbiKPmzF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/cbiKPmzF</a></p>

<p>To clarify more - first of all - the line:
var parameters:Array = game.coasts.getDockInitializationParameterSet(0) wasn't touched at all!!!!!!
Second of all it says that it is added same on line 14. Again, it is not touched at all!!! the blank line is not even marked, but is displayed.
Does anyone know something about this completely weird and ALIEN behaviour of bitbucket?????? And how to mend this? I highly doubt it and am planning to give up on this combination of development (action script 3.0 on yosemite using bitbucket for git). I am getting all kinds of strange behavior on git using Mac that never happened to me on PC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub doesn't have any set disk quotas. We try to provide abundant

  that our servers are fast and downloads are quick for our users.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Rule of thumb: 1GB</strong></p>
  
  <p>For best performance, we recommend repositories be kept under 1GB
  each.  This limit is easy to stay within if large files (typically,
  binaries)  are kept out of the repo. If your repository exceeds 1GB,
  <strong>you might receive  a polite email from support requesting that you reduce the size of the repository  to bring it back down under 1GB</strong>.</p>

<p>My problem are tags. I tested it on console and it seems to be related to pushing tags.</p>

<p><code>git push origin 1.0.0</code> - I push tag only, <strong>without commit (How is this possible?)</strong><br>
It is visible on Repository (on BitBucket site) like a normal commit - with comment and ID. However commit cannot be downloaded from bitbutcket via git pull since it states it is up-to-date</p>

I have it set up so that I push new commits from my machine to the develop branch. I am currently the only developer but expect to have more in the future. I create a branch on my machine for a new feature, do the development, commit and merge that branch to develop on my machine and then push to develop in the Bit Bucket repo. I then push the code to our Staging server. This is currently set up.</p>
<p>There will be no development on the Staging server so I don't need a working tree (do I?). I just want it simple - push the code to Staging and the changes are merged into the existing code. If some correction to the code in Staging is needed, that will be done in the original feature branch on my machine and committed, merged and and pushed to 'develop' on Bit Bucket and again pushed to Staging.</p>
<p>Likewise, once the code on the Staging server is verified, I need to merge the code into 'Master' from 'develop' in the Bit Bucket repo and push to the Production server from 'Master' in a similar manner as I'm pushing to Staging. All simple and clean. I'm not ready to get into automation of pushes with hooks just yet.</p>
<p>One glitch I have with this is that Production server code is an image from another machine and so it currently has a lot of &quot;changes&quot; both &quot;modified&quot; and &quot;new&quot; that aren't really changes, but old code. I successfully handled a similar situation on the Staging server using:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/develop
</code></pre>
<p>My main question is about the type of git instance I should have on the Staging and Production servers. Should they be bare? I think I have no use for a working tree since there will be no development on either server, but I don't know if a bare installation contains everything needed for a live server.</p>

<p>User/Documents/Work/Project</p>

I have also managed to get it to work going to a live server for initial setup. All other commands sent to the server are working.</p>

<p>The code used for this particular part is:</p>

<pre><code>ssh $SUSER@$SHOST ""git clone --depth 1 git@bitbucket.org:team/$SITEADDRESS.git --branch staging $CURRDIR""

So I set up another shiny app to receive the webook. I know that doing this through a shiny app is <em>very</em> much less than optimal, but I just want to get something going now and then I'll come back later with a better solution.</p>

<p>So I set the webhook to request a certain url, but currently that doesn't matter. The problem I'm having when I load the page is that the app can't run <code>git pull</code> via <code>system2</code> (or <code>system</code> for that matter). The user shiny can successfully run <code>git pull</code>, and it can also successfully run <code>git pull</code> via a <code>system2</code> or <code>system</code> command in the R interpreter.</p>

<p>Here's what the app looks like:</p>

<pre><code>library(shiny)

setwd(""/home/shiny/myrepo"")
result &lt;- system2(""git"", ""pull"", stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE)

ui &lt;- bootstrapPage(
        textOutput(""result"")
)


# Define the server code
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
        output$result &lt;- renderText(result)
}

# Return a Shiny app object
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
</code></pre>

<p>When I load the page</p>

<pre><code>Permission denied (publickey).
 fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something I'm not accounting for with how Shiny server runs? My ssh key is stored in <code>keychain</code> with an <code>ssh-agent</code>, so that shouldn't be a problem. The permissions are correct, I believe, on the app.R file and the repo (shiny is the owner and group on both, and, again, can perform the <code>git pull</code> on the repo from the shell and from the R interpreter). </p>

<p>I'm guessing it's something to do with Shiny server and its ability to access the /home/shiny/.ssh folder?</p>

The problem is that this needs to happen 'blindly' to the user, but it pauses for a password.  I need to figure out a way to pipe (or <code>proc.communicate()</code> (or something) the password to the <code>repo.fetch()</code> or <code>origin.update()</code> proc.</p>

<p>Currently, I have code that's something like this:</p>

<pre><code>remoteUrl = 'http://uname@build:7990'
commitId = '9a5af460615'
pw = 'MyPassword'
repo = git.Repo('C:\\Myfolder\\MyRepo')
proc = subprocess.Popen('echo pw | repo.git.fetch()', shell=True, stdin = PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn't seem to work
if I done try the echo/pipe, but follow <code>repo.git.fetch()</code> with <code>proc.communicate(pw)</code>, I get error: </p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;interactive input&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Python34\lib\subprocess.py"", line 941, in communicate
    self.stdin.write(input)
TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I've also tried adding:</p>

<pre><code>o = repo.remotes.origin
proc = subprocess.Popen('o.update()', shell=True, stdin = PIPE)
proc.communicate(pw)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;interactive input&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Python34\lib\subprocess.py"", line 941, in communicate
    self.stdin.write(input)
TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>

<p>But to no avail, as you can see from the error.</p>

<p>I think I'm over-complicating this, as it seems gitpython probably has a good way to send the pw to <code>o.update()</code> or <code>repo.git.fetch()</code> without using the <code>subprocess</code>?</p>

<p>EDIT:
I'm hoping for code something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>remoteUrl = 'http://uname@build:7990'
commitId = '9a5af460615'
pw = 'MyPassword'
repo = git.Repo('C:\\Myfolder\\MyRepo')
repo.fetch(remoteUrl)
repo.checkout(commitId) # or maybe repo.pull, or something?
</code></pre>

<p>That is more pseudocode than anything else, but it may help you see what I'm hoping for. Also, I want to force through any 'hiccups'  I don't want detached head warnings or anything, I want to completely replace the local working copy with the remote at the specified commit.</p>

I only mention BitBucket so that folks are aware that I am <strong>not</strong> using GitHub and as such, <em>can't</em> solve the problem with GitHub-specific solutions. But again, I think the answer is 100% on the git command-line.</p>
<p>Also, if given the preference between a BitBucket UI-based solution, or a pure git command-line solution, I certainly prefer the latter!</p>
<hr />
<p>I've got a cart-before-the-horse scenario going on here.</p>
<p>I was asked to create a new project and write some code for it, because at the time the people I'm working with weren't ready for a new repository to be created in their BitBucket workspace. So I got a POC working locally, named my project <code>some-service</code> and now am ready to push that project up to a new BitBucket repository to share with other devs. I would like both a main and develop branch (or whatever is the norm for git/BitBucket these days).</p>
<p>Problem is, they are not willing to give me &quot;Create New Repository&quot; permissions, and so they are insisting that <em>they</em> create the repository and simply give me read/write access to it. So, on BitBucket, they have created a new repository called <code>some-service</code> that contains a <code>README.md</code> and a <code>.gitignore</code> and it has a sole <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p>Normally on GitHub, I create the repos myself, and they have a <code>main</code> branch, and GitHub provides me with a few commad lines to connect/sync up my existing local repo with the new one on GitHub.</p>
<p>What can I do here, ideally solely from the git command line, so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am able to either clone this repo, or <code>git init</code> my local <code>some-service</code> project, and &quot;connect them&quot; so that I can <code>git push</code> on the command line and push those changes to branches in the remote project on BitBucket; and</li>
<li>I am able to set the code in my local copy as the <code>main</code> branch and push that to BitBucket; and</li>
<li>Create a <code>develop</code> branch in BitBucket and pull that branch down, so that both locally and on BitBucket, I have <code>main</code> and <code>develop</code>.</li>

So now my staging branch is 31 commits ahead of my <code>dev</code> branch (oops) but it's worth noting that each branch is its own environment and I didn't ignore certain config files before doing this branching. So I have a few files that I'm not trying to overwrite, which is why I want to tell Git/Bitbucket something like ""<strong>Dev, Staging and Master are where they should be and we will track every commit from now on...forget the past.</strong>"" Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>So, recently we had a 3rd party developer who was making a whole bunch of customizations on our soon to be live website, basically disappear from us. They had been using Git. However, just before they went offline, they transferred the Git Repo to me. Until that time, I had never used Git. Due to time constraints, I took it upon myself to complete most of the final changes needed on our website, directly on the server taking actual backups along the way. At one point, I tried to sync the server back to master, but I got denied because I could potentially over-right some files. I tried reading some thread, and sadly, I ended up running a hard reset on my Git. I tried a restore, but that doesn't seem to have reset my git situation.</p>

<p>Now, I want to take ALL the changes that have been completed on the SERVER, and start a new Git master Repo. I'm ok, with wiping any branches that previously existed, but I have no idea how to link the server to a new Git repo (that I just created in bitbucket), and push all of the required content to the new repo. I'm afraid of getting these sequences wrong, as I don't want to have to ""start over"" (albeit, I have a full magento 2 backup of my server, taken an hour or so ago).</p>

<p>The repo's are being hosted on Bitbucket if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>I do have a local install of Sourcetree, but I have no idea how to really use it properly.</p>

<p>As for the old repo, I won't delete it, and I have a copy of the master/origin repo in my SourceTree (that I'll likely zip and then remove completely once this is done).</p>

<p>Once, I have the master updated, I'll want to deploy this to another backup/dev server, that was again previously sync'd to the old git.</p>

<p>any and all help is appreciated.</p>

Reading documentation and articles I've found the following structure good for us:</p>

<p>We have a repository in a Bitbucket. <strong>Master</strong> branch is considered to contain stable code only. Every dev must create his own branch and implement features/bugfixes in his <strong>own</strong> branch. Once he decides, that his code is ready, he creates a nice branch history (using rebase, amend, cherry-pick etc.) and pushes it to Bitbucket, where creates a pull request to master branch. QA verifies functionality and approves (or disapproves) it, then I'm verifying code and if it is ok, I merge his work into master (by fast-forward or rebasing for better commits history).</p>

<p>But this scheme is good only in a case, when single developer works on a branch. In our case we almost always have two developers for one branch, since one developer is working on <em>server-side</em> (PHP), and another - <em>client-side</em> (HTML/CSS/JS). How these two should collaborate in a way, that commit history in master stays clean?</p>

<p>Server dev creates basic structure of HTML files and client dev needs to get this structure. Logically would be for server dev to create a branch, and for client dev to create his own branch, based on server dev branch. But this means, that server dev needs to <em>publish</em> his branch in Bitbucket, which will make it <em>impossible for him to rebase or change commits</em>, that are already published.</p>

<p>Another option is to wait, until server dev finishes his work, publishes branch with nice commits history and forgets about it, and only after that client dev starts to work in this branch, but this will cause time delays, which is even worse.</p>

<p>How do you handle such a collaboration in your workflows?</p>

chapters/chapter1.tex
...
chapters/chapterN.tex 
main.pdf

<p>I would like to make <code>main.pdf</code> publicly available and distribute a link pointing to it, while keeping the remaining files private. Is there a way to achieve this?</p>

That's fine, you can do that, but please also address the question that I have.</p>

<p>I made some very, very bad mistakes in my git repo which blew it up to several gigabytes, yikes! Luckily, this is my own private repo, so I went through and rewrote history to remove all the mistakes. I followed <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Maintenance-and-Data-Recovery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these instructions</a>, basically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find all the files I want to remove.</li>
<li>Use git-filter-branch to remove them.</li>
<li>Remove the records from the logs and refs</li>
<li>Re-garbage collect.</li>
</ol>

<p>Doing this, I got the repo down from several gigabytes to a single megayte, yay! I followed up with a <code>git push origin --force --all</code>, and everything updated successfully.</p>

<p>Now, I want to clone my repo into a new system to test that my rewrite worked. When I clone, I get this:</p>

<pre><code>remote: Enumerating objects: 6359, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6359/6359), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4857/4857), done.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly 1.70 GiB | 3.05 MiB/s
</code></pre>

<p>This seems strange to me. First of all, my repo is no longer several gigabytes, it is only 1 megabyte. Additionally, I do not have 6539 objects. After the rewrite, I only have 2128 objects. It seems like it is downloading the repo before I pushed the rewrite.</p>

<p>So my question is: How can I get the remote repo to see that I've rewritten history to make the repo much, much smaller?</p>

<p>What I want is the <em>reverse</em> alphabetical order.</p>

  <p>You can sort result sets using the ?sort= query parameter, available

<p>but it seems this trick doesn't work for <code>orderBy</code>; when I try <code>orderBy=-ALPHABETICAL</code>, it's the same as <code>orderBy=ALPHABETICAL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> the other developer was able to get around the issue by generating a new SSH key <em>without</em> a passphrase, but this is contrary to the instructions Atlassian itself provides for creating SSH keys, so maybe this leads itself to being more of a stash issue then.</p>

<p>It has reached the part of the repo where branches started to be used more widely. It has now slowed to a crawl. The branches are causing it serious grief. It is down to maybe one commit for every 2-3 minutes. Each new branch seems to slow the whole operation down even more. </p>

<p>I'm not sure where it's spending time. Is it an i/o or cpu intensive operation? Atlassian recommends running the operation where SVN is; on the local disk - no network trip. I don't if that would help though as it's not spending time pulling down files from SVN. Is it running commits on the branch and that is not shown on the console? </p>

<p>I don't think it's feasible to pull this into Bit Bucket. I think it would be better to move all new development to Bit Bucket and continue running SVN. At the current rate of conversion it will take several years to complete.</p>

For now I remotely login to this VM and execute a <code>git pull</code> command if I've pushed a new piece of code to the repo.

<p>In the virtual machine there is a directory for the repo, say, <code>C:\project</code> (yes, it's running Windows, *sigh*). I've tried putting a <code>post-receive</code> hook into <code>C:\project\.git\hooks</code> directory with some ""hello-world"" code, like</p>

We have one main repository which is created by me. My friend forked it and cloned it to his local machine.</p>

<p>Now when I make some changes I push commits to my repository by doing:</p>

<pre><code>git add -u
git commit -m ""message""
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>I'm getting changes from repository by <code>git pull</code> command.</p>

<p>My friend is commiting changes by executing commands:</p>

<pre><code>git add -u
git commit -m ""message""
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>and he is getting changes from repo by <code>git pull upstream master</code> command.</p>

<p>After we do it we have problem with synchronizing our repositories. When my friend creates Pull Request it says there are conflicts... and it happens each time we push commits.</p>

<p>How to make it work that if my friend do some changes and create Pull Request, git will automatically add his lines of code without any conflicts to my repo?</p>

We have a base project which is acting as a platform for other projects.</p>

<p>let's say the base project is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>project-base</strong></p>

<p>file-base-1</p>

<p>file-base-2</p>

<p>file-base-3</p>

<p>the other project which is built upon the base-project should be as follows:</p>

<p><strong>project-module</strong></p>

<p>file-base-1</p>

<p>file-base-2</p>

<p>file-base-3</p>

<p>file-module-1</p>

<p>file-module-2</p>

<p>file-module-3</p>

<p>the problem with fork is that if we change <strong>file-base-1</strong> in the <strong>project-module</strong> and also we have some changes in the <strong>project-base</strong> on the same file we hit a merge conflict which should be manually resolved but that is not a proper way of doing things since we may have over 20 commits per day on common files.</p>

<p>in visual studio, you can consider <strong>file-base-1</strong> as a .sln file which tracks projects files. the <strong>sln-base.sln</strong> file has all the <strong>project-base</strong> settings and when we do a fork in to <strong>project-module</strong> the initial .sln file is the same as <strong>sln-base.sln</strong></p>

<p>after that we may add some other files to the <strong>project-module</strong> so the sln file is updated. but this leads to the problem. renaming the .sln file also does not help since when we do a sync from master to the forked project the .sln file wants to be overwritten on the <strong>sln-module.sln</strong> ,so git asks us to do a manual conflict resolving procedure.</p>

<p>what is the best practice using git in scenarios like this?</p>

<p>Now, I would like to be able to isolate a folder (let's call it ""resources"") which will hold some resource files such as graphics, scripts, sounds which are not really crucial to the coders on the project. The coders must not be able to pull from or synch with this folder.</p>

<p>However, another team should be able to manipulate this ""resources"" folder and make changes to it, while also being able to receive the changes made by the coders.</p>

<p>I understand that there is an ignore function that creates a .gitignore list. But as I understand it, this list will ignore files/folders across all users so nobody will effectively be able to access the ""resources"" folder as soon at it's defined to be ignored.</p>

<p>Another way would be to branch the ""origin"" into a ""coders"" branch and ""resources"" branch. Then the ""coders"" would push and pull to/from remote ""coders"", push to (but never pull from) ""origin"" and also never push to ""resources"".

I want to back it/version control it so that when I move to a new work station, I can override the default <code>workspace.xml</code> with this one and have all my configurations.</p>

<p>Is it possible that I back up the <code>workspace.xml</code> file at a path other than <code>baseDir/something/something/.idea/workspace.xml</code> in Bitbucket eg. <code>baseDir/IDESettings/idea/workspace.xml</code>? </p>

<p>If I change <code>baseDir/something/something/.idea/workspace.xml</code> on my local machine (say add or change a new build configuration), a new version should get created in <code>baseDir/IDESettings/idea/workspace.xml</code> and I move to a new machine and install the IntelliJ IDE then the <code>workspace.xml</code> from <code>baseDir/IDESettings/idea/workspace.xml</code> should be used.</p>

<p>I am guessing that I might have to use symbolic links but I would appreciate if someone could confirm this or suggest an alternative.</p>

The development work is done on my personal computer. When I'm happy with what I have, I push to bitbucket. Then, I go to my production server, issue <code>git pull origin master</code> and everything works nicely.</p>

<p>As the application matures, I need to create a development (or rather, staging) branch that is also available on the web server, attaches to its own database and can be used to test new features.</p>

<p>So, what I (think) I want to do is create a new branch called <code>staging</code>, and have that occupy a separate directory on the webserver. I will have a .gitignore'd environment file that tells it how to access the staging database. </p>

<p>Once I'm happy with changes I made on my development machine, I'll push them to staging. Then, once they have been tested in the ""real"" world, I'll merge the changes into master and the production server will enjoy all the updates.</p>

<p>Now, my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I create a new branch that is essentially a copy of master? </li>
<li>How do I create a new directory on the web server to hold this branch without affecting the master branch which is in another directory?</li>
<li>How do I merge the staging branch into the master branch without destroying the staging branch?</li>

<p>My question: Is there a way that I can integrate their repo with mine? Maybe by deploying commits made to their master branch into a branch in my repo (e.g. dev, stage or feature branches)?</p>

<p>One flaw I see with this approach is how to handle getting my repos changes back to their repo. Is there a way I could manage that? Or is this a lost cause?</p>

<p>As a workaround, I thought I can just host the jar files in BitBucket and that is where the launcher application will download the executable files from.

I setup a script to generate lots of files and version tags which left me with approximately 45000 tags. We are using Atlassian Stash for our Git server, so I pushed my commits up to a remote repository there without problem, but when I went to push the tags, I got the following error.</p>

<p>If I manually push a tag with <code>git push tagname-1.0</code> I can push it fine (though it takes a little time). I am currently pushing all my tags with a bash loop, but this has been running for over 24 hours at this point.</p>

<p>Is there some performance issues or limitation with using and/or pushing lots of tags? Is there something wrong with our configuration that might be causing this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> I just created a local bare git repo and pushed my many-tags repo to it. I then attempted pushing the tags and got the same remote hang up error, so I do not think this is an issue with Stash.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> As a temporary work around, I am able to push all branches, 100 at a time, with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git tag | xargs -n 100 git push origin

<p>I just attempted to do a local clone to see if I get all my tags as part of the clone and it has taken an incredibly long time (about an hour), but all the tags seem to have transferred correctly. I tried cloning a second time to a new directory and it was much faster, under a minute. Perhaps it reused a pack file or just had more resources available on my machine.</p>

<li><p>Problem: Stash will not perform the merge if there are merge conflicts, but the merged state is not tested at all until after the merge to mainline. We don't know if the mainline will break until it does.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Developer develops on feature/VHPC-1 (feature branches are covered by normal CI in TeamCity)</li>
<li>The developer pushes from feature/VHPC-1 to feature/VHPC-1/review (where we rebase the integration branch and then do CI (testing the merged state))</li>
<li>When the feature is done, the developer creates a pull request: feature/VHPC-1/review --> mainline</li>
<li><p>When the pull request is approved by another developer, it is automatically merged into the mainline by Stash (mainline is covered by normal CI in TeamCity)</p></li>
<li><p>Problem: The time (20 min - 1 day?) between the merged state is tested and the integration happens allows changes in the integration branch which could mean the merged state no longer works. Chance that integration branch breaks.</p></li>
<li>Problem: Twice the number of branches means some extra complexity and work.</li>
</ul>

<p>WORKFLOW 3</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer develops on feature/VHPC-1 (feature branches are covered by normal CI in TeamCity)</li>
<li>When the feature is done, the developer creates a pull request: feature/VHPC-1 --> feature/VHPC-1/review</li>
<li><p>When another developer approves and merges the pull request, feature/VHPC-1/review will be automatically built and tested in the merged state, and automerged to mainline on success</p></li>
<li><p>Problem: Twice the number of branches means some extra complexity and work.</p></li>
<li>Problem: Commits must always be integrated into mainline, and only cherry-picked to release branches.</li>

<ul>
<li>Developer develops on feature/VHPC-1 (feature branches are covered by
normal CI in TeamCity) </li>
<li>When the feature is done, the developer
creates a pull request: feature/VHPC-1 --> mainline TeamCity
automatically adds itself a reviewer, and tries to build and test the
pull request - in the merged state (using Stash's undocumented
refs/pull-requests/merge) </li>
<li><p>If the automatic verification passes,
TeamCity will approve the pull request. A human may then review,
approve and merge it into the mainline. </p></li>
<li><p>Problem: TeamCity monitors
refs/pull-requests/merge which changes when the integration branch
changes, meaning a build would be triggered on all open pull requests

Only a few days ago when I got the client with the BitBucket repo, I've decided to try it out and have installed SourceTree, pulled a repo there and everything was ok. The problem occurred when I went on the project which was on my GitHub repo. I made changes, and with console did <code>add</code> and<code>commit</code>, and when I wrote <code>git push</code> this came out:</p>

<pre><code>warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master
</code></pre>

<p>So I figured I'd run the <code>git config --global push.default matching</code> command and try again. After that I got a message saying:</p>

<pre><code>Password for 'https://xyz@bitbucket.org':

<p>where <code>xyz</code> isn't even my username or username of shared repo users on BitBucket</p>

I was able to copy it using mirror and filtered the branch using the Filter-branch command:</p>

<p><code>git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter Ecommerce master</code></p>

<p>Where 'Ecommerce' is the folder name and master is the branch I'm trying to filter. </p>

<p>The filter appears to have worked and got rid of all the folders besides the 'Ecommerce' one. The folder only has 5MB of typescript files, but the .pack file inside the .git/objects/pack folder is 1.2 GB.
That seems extremely huge and appears to be lugging around the history for the old repository (which had a lot more code and data files).</p>

<p>So I read up a bit and tried the git-filter-repo command after deleting the tags:</p>

<p><code>git filter-repo --path / --invert-paths -f</code> </p>

<p>This reduces the .pack file to 9MB (which is really good) but it doesn't register as any changes in my local repository git. So I'm not sure how to push it to update the remote repository.</p>

<p>I set the remote:</p>

<p><code>git remote add origin https://code.com/myGitRepo.git</code></p>

<p><code>git push --set-upstream origin master (and with -f)</code></p>

<p>I tried clearing the gc</p>

<pre><code>git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
</code></pre>

<p>Even tried: 
<code>git repack -a -d -f --depth=250 --window=250</code></p>

<p>And the 1.2 GB .pack file is still pulled everytime I clone the remote repository, so its definitely not reduced on the remote repo.</p>

<p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong ? Or how to update the pack file/history so the repository size is reduced ?</p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is little different. I have two remote repositories, say <code>repo1</code> and <code>repo2</code>. Both repositories contain 3 branches - <code>master</code> branch, <code>release/1.0</code> branch, and <code>release/2.0</code> branch. My project is a generic Java application. <code>repo1</code> contains only java files, while <code>repo2</code> contains only JAR files, which are binary files.</p>
<p>I don't have any dependency management system like maven. I am trying to achieve this - When I switch to <code>release/1.0</code> branch, my java files will change according to <code>repo1</code> and the JAR files should also change according to <code>repo2</code>. Similarly, when I switch to <code>release/2.0</code> branch, my java files should change according to <code>repo1</code> and the JAR files should also change according to <code>repo2</code>. JAR files are different in release branches.</p>
<p>I will not be pushing JAR files to <code>repo2</code>, I don't have such a use case. I will be pushing only Java files, that too, to <code>repo1</code>.</p>
<p>Is this possible? or is there any workaround to achieve this?</p>

I am working on the build step that the pipelines will use before it deploys to azure. The only thing my build step does right now is output built files into a given directory which is gitignored. It then force adds the gitignored build folder. It then amends to the commit that triggered the pipeline, and finally force pushes the commit to master.</p>

<p>So my file looks something like this</p>

<h3>My question is:</h3>

<p><strong>Am I going to break anything with this git workflow? And are there any suggestions that you have?</strong></p>

<p>I'm figuring that only my pipelines script will push to azure's local repo
so it's okay to amend the commit which would otherwise probably be a bad idea if someone else pushes to it. Is this something I should be concerned about? I would like to keep the original commit message as azure displays it in the list of previous deploys. If they all have deploy names correlated with their bitbucket commits it makes it much simpler to go back to a certain deployment.</p>

<p>I was also wondering if this was an okay time to use <code>git push --force</code> as I hear the <code>--force</code> flag is considered dangerous. Since I am committing the build files to git for each deployment I will have a commit that strays away from the repo with all the build files in it. My thought was using <code>--force</code> would forget the last stray commit and just have everything the way bitbucket-pipelines built it. I'm not sure if my interpretation of <code>--force push</code> is correct.</p>

Let me clear things up here.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to git and I'm using bitbucket so part of this most likely comes from inexperience.</p>

<p>I'm noticing when I push things up to bitbucket, it pushes the ""guts"" of whatever is in my gitinit folder however with Concrete5 CMS packages, you need the parent folder, because it's referenced by a controller.php file inside.</p>

<p>The basic folder structure of a package in Concrete5 is like this:</p>

<pre><code>Root Dir: packages
     Dir:     my_package_name
                  controller.php (references the above folder name so it can't change)
</code></pre>

<p>Right now I'm doing a <code>git init</code> inside the package folder (<code>my_package_name</code> with the above example). </p>

<p>I'm making all my changes using a local Concrete5 install and then committing and pushing them up to bitbucket. That tracks the ""guts"" of my package well enough but if I were to say, share the bitbucket repo with a coworker and he just downloaded it from bitbucket directly, it would come down like <code>myteamname-my_repo_name-12243343.zip</code> and unzipping that just keeps the folder name with all that extra gobbledygook. It would not install correctly since the package  controller is just looking for <code>my_package_name</code>.</p>

<p>So I thought, well, I could just <code>gitinit</code> in the root Dir, <code>packages</code>... however that tracks ALL the packages, it would be a pain in the ass to shuffle through all of them, isolate which files to add and commit not to mention changing the remote repo every time I want to push to bitbucket. I could have 20-30 packages going at once so I don't think that's realistic unless I'm missing some key functionality of git. I definitely do not want them ALL in one repo either.</p>

<p>Outside of manually moving the packages in their parent folder out of my dev environment and then committing / pushing elsewhere, I'm not sure how to best handle this? That seems like a lot of extra work I'd rather not do not to mention leaves open the chance for things to go untracked.</p>

<p>Hi I am new to git, so we are working on a project in our office, we are using bitbucket. 
I have committed and pushed some lines of code.
To the same PR, another person has pushed their code.
How can I pull their code to my local repo?</p>

<p>I didn't update my code with theirs and when I tried to push my code I got the above error.
Upon force push, their commit was overridden.</p>

<p>'-1 guy' - fanks! Have a nice day now.</p>

<p>I'm new to chef and am trying to clone a repo to complete a simple learning task i set myself.</p>

<p>I've followed many tutorials and tried a plethora of suggestions but still unable to clone the repo due to public key error.</p>

<p>I'm replicating steps on a local terminal to make sure that I've not messed up the url or anything.</p>

<p>I've:</p>

<p>Created a new key ensuring no password set, uploaded the public key to bitbucket ad tested the key using ssh -T hg@bitbucket.org from local machine.</p>

<p>I've then added this key to a chef vault, verified it's there and visible.  </p>

<p>Then using chef I'm copying the key to a location on the client node and then attempting to clone the repo.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough when I run the hg@bit... command on the client node I am prompted for a password, I press enter and it fails.</p>

<p>I've cat'd the files both local and client and can confirm they are correct.<br>
I'm running as root on client node and have placed the keys in /root/.ssh, again verified by pwd.</p>

<p>Running verbose for the hg@bit... command on client again asks for the passphrase, on enter permission is denied.</p>

<p>Any help is hugely appreciated.  Below is the log and the chef recipe, thank you.</p>

<p>This problem had never occured with the other slave, and I do not recall having to do any credential configuration for the slave.  My suspicion is the following: I've already done some credential configuration stuff on my workstation (ssh access to the bbucket server, user name, etc. etc.).  Is it possible that my local git credential configurations are in conflict with what is requested by the Jenkins slave node?  Maybe someone who understands better how credentials are being managed by jenkins and by git can help me to understand the situation better so I can work towards a solution?  Currently, I don't even know how to go about debugging my problem.</p>

<p>Thank you ahead of time for your help, and I'll try and be prompt with responses to any questions for clarification.</p>

Also added the <code>--progress</code> flag so git will output stderr even if it isn't connected to the console since we are piping the output to awk.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4062862/git-stderr-output-cant-pipe"">git stderr output can&#39;t pipe</a></li>
<li><code>clip</code> does not accept parameters at the command line and input must be piped into it.</li>

The repo is now over 2GB, which has caused Bitbucket to put it into read-only mode. Because it is in read-only mode, I cannot push changes that would reduce the repo size. (Catch 22.)</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> My company recently began hosting git repositories on Bitbucket. One of the repositories I am in charge of had a size of about 973MB, which was uncomfortably close to the 1GB soft limit. To reduce the repo size, I followed the instructions in the Bitbucket documentation article <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Split+a+repository+in+two"" rel=""noreferrer"">Split a repository in two</a> and moved about 450MB worth of documentation and online help files into their own private repo. I then followed the instructions in the Bitbucket documentation articles <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Reduce+repository+size"" rel=""noreferrer"">Reduce repository size</a> and <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Maintaining+a+Git+Repository"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maintaining a git repository</a>, specifically:</p>

<p><code>git count-objects -vH</code> showed me a size-pack of about 973MB.</p>

<p>I ran <code>git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch doc' HEAD</code> to remove the doc directory (which is the content I'd moved to the new repo).</p>

<p>I ran the following commands to expire reference and prune:</p>

<pre><code>git for-each-ref --format=""%(refname)"" refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
</code></pre>

<p><code>git count-objects -vH</code> then showed me a size-pack of 881.1 MiB and <code>du -sh .git/objects</code> returned 882M. I was disappointed that moving over 450MB reduce the repo size by less than 90MB, but pushed the changes to Bitbucket nevertheless:</p>

<pre><code>git push --all --force
git push --tags --force
</code></pre>

<p>The settings page for the Bitbucket copy of the repo continued to show a size of 973MB. I logged out, refreshed the browser, logged back in, but that didn't help -- the repo size remained at 973MB.</p>

<p>This morning (three days after the changes described above) I made a couple of minor additions to two existing files which increased the files' sizes by a total of less than 1KB, added and commited them to my local repo, then pushed the change to Bitbucket. A few minutes later I took a look at the Bitbucket page for the repo and saw a red warning banner informing me ""This repo is over the 2 GB limit and is in read-only mode."" The settings page now says the repo has a size of 2.3 GB.</p>

<p>The push of a few hundred bytes added to two files was definitely the only activity to occur on the remote repo in the last three days, according to Bitbucket. That push may not have been the cause of the repo more than doubling in size, but the two events were closely correlated in time.</p>

<p><code>git reflog show</code> returns nothing.</p>

<p>Cloning a new copy into an alternate directory, then running git count-objects give me a size-pack of 881.29 MiB.</p>

<p>The local repository is on a CentOS 6.5 system. git version is 1.8.5.3.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why did moving 450MB of files out of the repo only reduce the size of my local repo by 90MB?</li>
<li>Why did even that modest reduction not get pushed to the remote repo on Bitbucket?</li>
<li>How on Earth did the remote repo size jump from 973MB to 2.3GB?</li>
<li>How do I fix it? I cannot push to the remote repo even with the --force flag. Any push gets me the error message ""conq: repository is in read only mode (over 2 GB size limit).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.""</li>

The end result is that a <code>git diff develop..feature-branch</code> shows a completely unexpected diff. </p>

<p>For instance, one file that was added in develop appears as a delete in the diff. Many other files show similar issues, some missing, some added, many many unexpected changes. Some files that should have been in <code>develop</code> do not even appear in the diff. We first noticed the issue in Atlassian Stash when we went to review the code via a Pull Request. The pending merge is completely and utterly incorrect and cannot be resolved through standard conflict resolution during the merge.</p>

<p>We attempted to decipher what caused this and we believe the problem stems from a developer performing several resets on commits in the feature branch that were already pushed to origin. This was to ""revert"" some changes suggested during a pull request code review. Specifically, we believe this to be the timeline of events.</p>

<ol>
<li>Feature branch created from develop</li>
<li>Work performed on feature branch</li>
<li>Pull request generated in Atlassian Stash (PR looks ok, but some minor edits suggested)</li>
<li>Developer uses a reset to revert some changes and pushes those to origin</li>
<li>Meanwhile minor conflicts noticed between develop and feature branch</li>
<li>Developer updates feature branch from develop to reconcile conflicts and pushes to origin</li>
<li>Pull request (diff) shows unexpected diff, drastically different from the one before. Files that are expected to be committed are missing and vice versa</li>
<li>I attempt to undo (revert not reset) the ""bad"" merge and try it again. However the PR/diff shows the same incorrect changes for the pending merge</li>
<li>I then learn that the developer used reset somewhere prior to the first merge from develop.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I have three questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How we need to ""recover"" a corrected feature branch so we can merge our changes into develop correctly? My thought is to create a new ""good"" feature branch from a commit in our feature branch that is a known to occur before the resets. I can then cherry pick the commits we want from the ""bad"" feature branch into the ""good"" one to recreate it. Finally, I can merge the ""good"" feature branch into develop and delete the ""bad"" one.</p></li>
<li><p>If I were to merge the ""bad"" feature branch into develop, aside from the incorrect state of the files, would there be any other ""corruption"" leaked into the develop branch. That is, would the polluted ""bad"" feature branch further pollute the develop branch and anything downstream from it? I do not plan to do this of course, but I do want to understand the ramifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Would resets as I have described them cause the issues that I am seeing or is this possibly related to something else? </p></li>

<p>When I enter this command: <code>git status</code>, I'll see all folders/files with red color. Because of that I entered this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .

<p>Now they are green! Also I wrote a commit for it by this line:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -m ""there isn't any change""
</code></pre>

<p>And then to sync my local directory with the one on the bitbucket, I entered this line:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>But I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master

<p>So it <em>has</em> been merged, or closed, or something, according to Bitbucket. (But it's still in the clones coming from Bitbucket.)

<p>What I can't decide on is whether to clone each repository as --bare or --mirror.</p>

<p>The scripted process seems pretty straight forward. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get the repositories from bitbucket.org and write them to a file for use and to keep as a log. (already done and works)</p></li>
<li><p>Read the file, extract the repositories, repo slug(repo name) and clone them.(already working with --mirror)</p></li>
<li><p>For each cloned repo, run:</p>

<ul>
<li>git gc --auto to cleanup repos</li>
<li>Create repo from slug on <strong>new</strong> on premise server</li>
<li>git remote set-url <strong>origin</strong> ssh://<strong>on_prem_server</strong>:7999/PROJ/REPO</li>
<li>git push --all origin</li>
<li>git push --tags origin</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So I am not actually mirroring the bitbucket.org repos but migrating them. My understanding is that git clone --mirror gives a <strong>true copy</strong> of original. While git clone --bare does not and needs <strong>at least</strong> a fetch afterwards. This is why I initially thought using --mirror was best.</p>

<p>But now I am worried that there could be some danger in using a mirror.</p>

<p>So my questions are.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any dangers using git clone --mirror I should be aware of?</li>
<li>Should I even use --mirror or is --bare good enough?</li>

<li><code>next</code> is periodically rewound (say, after a release). </li>
<li><strong>The <code>next</code> branch should never be merged into the <code>master</code> branch</strong> </li>

<p>It would be useful to be able to <strong>automatically prevent merges of <code>next</code> into <code>master</code></strong>, either directly or via another branch based on <code>next</code>. <strong>How can one accomplish this using git?</strong></p>

<p>Note: as described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13381105/git-hook-to-prevent-an-experimental-branch-pushed-to-a-release-or-master-branch"">this question</a>, it is possible to use git hooks to prevent these types of merges on a remote repository one has full access to. However, this is (presumably) not possible with services like BitBucket or GitHub, so I seek a solution that works with a local repository, or one which can be used with a remote repository that one only has limited administrative access to.</p>

<p>I'm working with a repo that is very large because of commits of numerous large files. I recently shallow cloned it (depth=1), then later pulled a large change on master. Then I branched, made a small commit, and pushed to that new branch. It's taking forever to push it up, even though it's only adding a small commit (15 kb, one file affected) on top of commit that the remote (Bitbucket) already knows about. The message I see looks like this:</p>

I use it for any private projects that I cannot open source. I use github for all of my open source work.</p>

<p>I do development on a desktop ubuntu machine and on my MacBookPro. As I make changes on my development systems, I push the changes to the origin in the colo and pull to the other system. I'm pretty good about keeping all three systems up-to-date for the most part, mostly for backup and disaster recovery purposes.</p>

<p>Now that BitBucket is offering private git hosting for free, I'm considering adding a clone of my projects there. Besides, then I could use the extra features provided by BitBucket that my barebones private git server doesn't provide. However, I'd like to continue to keep a copy of the private repos on my colo server as well for backup redundancy.</p>

<p>So I have a few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Without changing my standard development process (edit, add, commit, push), how can I automatically sync commits pushed to my server to a bitbucket project? Any time I push to my git server, I'd like those commits to automatically get pushed to my bitbucket project. I don't want to change my workflow and would like as little changes necessary to my development clients.</p></li>
<li><p>If I want to use bitbucket as my primary git repo, how do I migrate my projects from my private git server to bitbucket?</p></li>
<li><p>Once I migrate to bitbucket, I'd still like another backup on my server. How can I automatically have commits to bitbucket get pushed to my git server? This is basically the reverse of question 1.</p></li>

<p>I have a <code>master</code> branch where I want to have only stable working code. Any addition to this branch must come from a pull-request in bitbucket (could be github or something else, it's just the tool we use). So I want to create a git hook in my local repository to prevent any merging into the <code>master</code> branch but that also allows me to fetch/pull changes from my remote repository at bitbucket.</p>

<p>I already have git configured to disallow fast-forward merges.</p>

<p>I looked into these solutions that provide something similar, that is to say, a whitelist and a blacklist of branches that can/can't merge into master:</p>

<p>Also this solution prevents me from commiting directly into master, which is also very useful:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40462111/git-prevent-commits-in-master-branch"">Git: Prevent commits in master branch</a></p>

<p>However I'm not clear if any of these would prevent me from pulling in changes made by pull-requests in bitbucket/github into my local working repository.</p>

As suggested below I had also already setup <a href=""https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/branch-permissions-385912271.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">branch permissions</a> in my bitbucket repo, but that prevents me only from pushing merged <code>master</code> branches.

<p>Basically the guide involves setting up a bitbucket pipeline as follows:</p>
<pre><code>clone:
  depth: full

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: 'Mirror to Github repo....'
        script:
          - git push --mirror git@github.com:my-repo/repo.git
</code></pre>
<p>I have it (kinda) working, but the pipeline fails due to the following:</p>
<p><code>! [remote rejected] master (refusing to delete the current branch: refs/heads/master)</code></p>
<p>So it looks like the <code>git push --mirror</code> command first deletes all branches, is that correct?</p>
<p>I understand why the master delete won't work (not allowed unless it's an github admin) and I don't want to change the master etc.</p>
<p>I simply want to pipeline all git events on the bitbucket repo over to the github repo.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to do this without hitting this issue?</p>
<p>Separately, I know I could do this by adding another remove to the repo locally and then pushing from there, but I'm looking for a solution that can be handled server side to make it simple for the rest of my team to not have to start manually adding second remotes etc.</p>

<p>I am using a Notebook with Linux Debian 9, git for version control, bitbucket as source code repository service and netlify as production deployment service.
Besides I am using Contentful CMS API to quickly add new pages.</p>

<p>Yesterday I deleted my repository on bitbucket and pushed the same one with some slight changes freshly from my local ""backup"" repo to bitbucket today.</p>

<p>Pushing is just working fine. However, I cannot deploy with Netlify anymore...
I keep getting the following error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10:21:02 PM: Starting to prepare the repo for build 10:21:05 PM: git
  ref refs/heads/master does not exist or you do not have permission

  during stage 'preparing repo': git ref refs/heads/master does not
  exist 10:21:05 PM: Finished processing build request in 12.473521036s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I push, Netlify tries to build, so there is a connection between Bitbucket and Netlify but the build fails. In my local repo refs/heads/master does exist. git branch -a also tells me that my branch is master. On bitbucket the branch is also master. </p>

<p>Why won't Netlify build? Is there a problem with the API ID?
The API ID might only be valid for the repo I deleted yesterday but then Netlify and Bitbucket wouldn't be able to communicate, right?</p>

<p>I didn't make any changes in Netlify. The only thing I changed is the Repository on Bitbucket. I am assuming that I broke the API ID. I cannot change the API on Netlify, though. Also, there doesn't seem to be any option on Bitbucket for adding it. </p>

<p>And I don't even know if that is the problem. If it is, the only 2 options I have got is deleting the Netlify website and create a new one, choosing the bitbucket repo and granting Netlify full access to it. </p>

<p>But what happens if it won't deploy? Then it is offline and I won't be able to bring it up again. </p>

<p>Can anyone help me? What am I supposed to do? Let me know if you need any additional information.</p>

The reason I'm interested in using git altogether is because I have a core of MATLAB and Python code which, for computational reasons, is spread across multiple UNIX clusters and I simply cannot keep track of the different versions by simple copying and pasting. 
For that reason, I have a private BitBucket repo and I want to make it such that the code is effectively shared between the clusters.</p>

<p>The MATLAB / Python core is something I want to keep up to date, perhaps on my server's master branch. The only thing that might change across clusters is wrapper shell scripts that organize compute node jobs that run the code core. Some servers are Torque / MAUI - based, so they need utilities such as <code>qsub</code>, while others are SLURM-based, so they need scripts such as <code>sbatch</code>. In addition, because the different clusters have different hardware configurations which point towards different methods of parallelization, I also expect there to be a slightly different directory structure on every cluster. For example, in one of the servers I am limited to 4 jobs being able to be submitted simultaneously, while on the other server there is no limit (well, no limit for the stuff that I want to do anyway). Without delving too much into the details, this changes the directory structure of my input data and consequently changes the filesystem names that my shell scripts read from (and to).</p>

<p>Based on this information, what would people think is the best possible branching setup for me? Should I make one separate server branch for every cluster that I have access to? Should I stick to one master branch and aggressively merge with it every single time I make a change on one of my clusters? Please keep in mind that this situation, where I'm the only contributor in this project, is <strong>very unlikely</strong> to change. </p>

(Just in quotes because there's no issues I see except the git blame)</p>

<p>It would be very useful to retain git blame information from the old repo where the files originated. Is this possible? There have been many commits and refactorings since the original copy to another repo was made. The old repo is a useful archive mono-repo reference and not used at this point.</p>

<p>I believe it would have been possible if the original move was done by overwriting origin/master with the new repo location, as I've done this before and it kept history. But now that so much work has been done on it, I don't know how to resolve the issue. </p>

<p>Potential idea: </p>

<ol>
<li>Clone or worktree the archival mono-repo</li>
<li>Find exact commit with desired history from archival repo that was used to start the new repo</li>
<li>Check out new branch recover_blame to do merging work in</li>
<li>Change origin/master remote to point to the new repo</li>
<li>I believe the only option here is to rebase master onto branch recover_blame? Merge won't recover the original git blame?</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe there is a huge caveat with rebasing master in that it will completely screw up everyone with branches off of it, won't it? It breaks the golden rule of rebasing, don't rebase a branch someone else has already started working off. I think this would work if we all agreed to it and did it, but there's never going to be a good time to do it. Is there a safer way to get the blame history back without breaking everyone?</p>

<p>None of these commits is available in Bitbucket any more. The project status is at latest local commit. What can I do? Is it even possible to revert this?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>So what I want: 
I have a project status  (that was after my latest commit, so commit 00544...) and then i pulled the status from that latest commit. So there was a version after that latest commit I did not commit and where I want to go back to. I know that this is possible to revert in eclipse when using Subversion. But I do not know, if it is a git feature. Since I am not using eclipse atm (I am building a {N}-app) I have no idea how I could undo this last command.</p>

<p>Someone essentially merged our <code>develop</code> branch in to our <code>master</code> branch via a pull request in bitbucket. This just happened today, so it's the last thing that was done on the master branch (we don't have to worry about other commits on top of the merge commit). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We host bitbucket ourselves, so we have an older version of bitbucket. There is no revert pull request option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I've read, there is essentially two ways of handling this in git:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>git reset --hard *&lt;SHA of commit before the merge&gt;*</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This will remove the merge commit as if it never happened.</li>
<li>Everywhere I read that ""it's bad practice to rewrite history"" or ""never do this on a publicly shared repo"" but they never really explain why not to do it. This seems like it will fix the problem, and it won't become a problem 6 months from now when we actually do want to redo this merge from <code>develop</code> to <code>master</code></li>
<li>If this is the best way to do it, and we do it, what happens to the pull request in bitbucket? That pull request still exists in bitbucket, but we are removing the merge commit it created, so will that mess up bitbucket in any way?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>git revert -m 1 *&lt;SHA of the merge commit&gt;*</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This will create a new commit that undoes the changes that were done by the merge</li>
<li>This would be fine, except we do intend to merge <code>develop</code> into <code>master</code> at a later date (the next release), and from what I've read, we would have to remember to revert our revert commit before doing this, because otherwise when we merge <code>develop</code> into <code>master</code>, the changes that we revert today won't be included. I really don't want to have this become a problem 6 months from now, when no one remembers this revert.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm hesitant on doing <code>git revert</code> because of the issues it could cause 6 months from now when we do want to do this merge again. I'm also hesitant on doing <code>git reset</code> because everyone seems to warn against doing it, and it could cause issues with the pull request on bitbucket.</p>

<p>To start with, <code>Build Path</code> is missing. That is, if I right click on my project, the build path submenu just lists <code>No actions available</code> (and there is no Build Path section if I open the project's properties' window).</p>
<p>Background: I started a Java-project locally, without using Git. I changed my mind a couple of times where to store the project so I have moved it twice. After the first, but before the last, move I added the project to Bitbucket.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way stuff broke but since I knew I had working copy at Bitbucket, I just deleted everything stored locally and checked out a fresh copy. But this doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have this hierarchy in Eclipse when looking in the Project Explorer:</p>
<pre><code>projA
        A
        B
        C
</code></pre>
<p>In A-C I then have</p>
<pre><code>A
    src
        A
            AMyMainClass.java
            SupportClass.java
</code></pre>
<p>Comments</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not sure if <code>A</code> ocurred twice like that in the project when it worked.</li>
<li>I should have JRE at some level (probably next to <code>src</code>) in this hierarchy but it is missing</li>
<li>When everything works as expected you should be able to &quot;expand&quot; the source files and see the methods. That is missing for me.</li>
<li>The source files have the outline J symbol, rather than the correct, filled J:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WkMpz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WkMpz.png"" alt=""outlined J java class"" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, on Bitbucket, it looks a bit different:</p>
<pre><code>ARepo
    A
    B
    C
    .gitignore-default
    .project
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see the <code>projA</code> level is missing. Also, <code>.project</code> is quite empty, see the end of this post for its content (mostly <code>&lt;name&gt;proj&gt;&lt;/name&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>A-C, in their turn,</p>
<pre><code>A
    .settings/
    src/A/
    .classpath
    .gitignore
    .project
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The content of .classpath and .gitignore seems reasonable</li>
<li>.project contains exactly the same as the file with the same name above (in the root of the repo)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some final notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>While adding code, I got a couple of warnings about Eclipse not being able to save the workspace and/or project settings or similar. Don't remember the details but that is the reason for the second move of the workspace (I started by storing the workspace and projects locally, then moved it to a network volume, these warnings popped up so I therefore decided to move it back to the local harddrive).</li>
<li>I have tried both the normal Git-import as well as the &quot;smart import&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not really sure what to ask now, but:</p>
<p><strong>How do I make my project work again? Why is the JRE missing? Why is the build path option missing? Anything else?</strong></p>

<p>Master was at commit <code>D</code> and this mistake happened: the branch at commit <code>A</code> has been mistakenly merged into master and pushed. Moreover the commit M does not contain all the changes in <code>A,B,C,...</code> because has been modified by hand before committing. All these commits have already been pushed.</p>

<p>I need to create a new branch with the same changes as in <code>[dev]</code> and merge it later into master, at the moment I can't because those commits have already been merged.
Also all the changes in <code>[dev]</code> comes from various merges from different branches.</p>

<p>Important limitation:
my git server does not allow me to force push into master branch, so I cannot reset master branch.</p>

<p>Is there a way to put changes in <code>[dev]</code> into <code>[master]</code> after a bad merge <code>[M]</code>?</p>

<p>EDIT: I am allowed to force push in branches which are not master.</p>

<p>I have use the solution of @gus3001.
I have made a folder configs with all the differents configs (dev / master / testing / etc) in it, and another, preset.json, which is referenced in .gitignore.</p>

<p>So on each branch switch, we just have to modify a short string in the ignored file.

<p>We currently use CVS, and have multiple on-going large-scale projects. We do new project production releases every month or so, but each project might be in development between 1 wk to 6 months. We also do weekly maintenance releases. There can be up to around a dozen or so projects in active development. We also need ability to run nightly regression testing on each project branch as well as maintenance. Given the per-file nature of CVS, we split manual merges between half a dozen developers when large-scale merges are needed.</p>

<p>So far my best idea is to use modified gitflow where we'll have the following branches:</p>

<p>master: what's currently in production</p>

<p>develop: development branch for next production release, project branches that will be released with next release will be merged here, as well as small features not release to larger projects (both new features and production bug-fixes)</p>

<p>project/project_name: Project development/integration/testing branches. This is branched off develop and is merged back to develop when project dev is complete. Some project/project_name branches can be branched off existing project/project_name branches if they require functionality of a project-in-development.</p>

<p>feature/ticket_no: feature branch, branched off from develop for smaller non-project features. Branched off from project/project_name for larger projects.</p>

<p>release/release_number: release branches, branched off from develop branch as we decide it's time to cut the release. Merged to master.</p>

<p>bugfix/ticket_no: bugfix branches, branched off from release/release_number branches for bugs found by QA. Merged back to release/release_number and develop.</p>

<p>hostix/ticket_no: hotfix for urgent production issues. branched off from master. Merged into master, develop, and release branches.</p>

<p>Does this sound workable, or am I shooting myself in the foot here due to huge merge complexity that will arise? Any suggestions for alternative approach?</p>

<p>Releasing more often is not a possibility to do limited ability to get approved downtime for a release.</p>

I'd like to work with a permanent personal branch, that I will periodically create merge requests from.</p>

<p>I'd like <code>git pull</code> to merge <code>origin/master</code> into my local <code>master</code>, and <code>git push</code> to push my local master into <code>origin/itsadok</code>. I will then create a merge request on the server, and merge my changes from <code>origin/itsadok</code> into <code>origin/master</code>.</p>

<pre><code>BitBucket server:   origin/itsadok --- via PR --&gt; origin/master
                       ↑                              |
Local machine:          \---------- master &lt;---------/
</code></pre>

<p>Seems simple enough.</p>

<p>I know I can manually do <code>git push origin master:itsadok</code>, but I'd like it do be the default. It seems that the only way to set the default push target is to config <code>branch.master.merge</code> to <code>refs/heads/itsadok</code> (and config <code>push.default</code> to <code>upstream</code>), but then pull will merge from my personal branch as well.</p>

<p>Is there a way to configure git so that the default push and pull will work as described above?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It occurred to me that I can achieve something very similar by setting <code>push.default</code> to <code>current</code>, naming the local branch the same as the remote personal branch, and setting <code>branch.itsadok.merge</code> to refs/heads/master. In other words:</p>

<pre><code>BitBucket server:   origin/itsadok --- via PR --&gt; origin/master
                       ↑                              |
Local machine:          \---------- itsadok &lt;--------/
</code></pre>

<p>This almost works, but because I have scripts that assume my local branch is called <code>master</code>, this solution is rather inconvenient for me. If there are no other idea, though, I'll settle for this.</p>

My remote is BitBucket and it all works nicely as intended. </p>

<p>Except, for <em>every</em> file I add to LFS, an entry is added to my <code>.git/config</code> that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[lfs ""https://bitbucket.org/%7B%7D/%7B********-****-****-****-****6bcd1adc%7D/info/lfs/object/verify?upload_id=********-d87a-47f9-a857-ae04********""]
    access = basic
</code></pre>

<p>(All the <code>*</code>'s are hexadecimal characters I removed for security reasons)</p>

<p>Since one entry is added for every file I track and push with LFS and I have hundreds of files in LFS, my git config file is now huge.</p>

<p>I think this issue started after switching my <code>origin</code> remote (from one BitBucket repo to another).</p>

<p><strong>What's going on and more importantly, how can I fix this?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Can I safely delete these entries from <code>.git/config</code>?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>For reference, this is how the BitBucket remote is configured in the same config file:</p>

<pre><code>[remote ""origin""]
    url = https://user@bitbucket.org/user/repository.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[lfs ""https://user@bitbucket.org/user/repository.git/info/lfs""]
    locksverify = false
    access = basic
[lfs ""https://bitbucket.org/user/repository.git/info/lfs""]
    access = basic
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what the LFS part of <code>.gitattributes</code> in the root of the repo looks like:</p>

<pre><code>...
database/seeds/sql/content/*/allcontent.sql filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
public/img/*/path1/*.normal@2x.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
public/img/*/path2/*.normal@2x.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>; I ran <code>git lfs uninstall</code> and then <code>git lfs install --local</code> in the repo to see if it fixes anything, it doesn't (that's to say, more lines were still being added to .git/config for new files I added to LFS). My <code>.git/config</code> file is now over 110KB large :S</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I was in touch with BitBucket, the only response I got so far is that this is expected behavior and something about pruning local LFS files, so I think they don't understand the issue I submitted. I <em>suspect</em> you can fix this the brutal way by removing the remote repository at BitBucket and all files tracked with LFS from your working directory, uninstalling Git LFS, removing the LFS directory from your Git repo, removing all <code>.gitattributes</code> lines that reference LFS, doing a new commit locally, using BFG or something like it to remove the references to all LFS-tracked files from all historic commits (depending on how you do it, this might make the tracked files go missing from all historical commits - I followed <a href=""https://dustinfreeman.org/blog/rip-lfs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article), then re-installing Git LFS and re-tracking and adding the files before pushing to a repo newly created at BitBucket. I did just this but without the final step of re-installing Git LFS - for now I'll just stick to tracking those files the regular way. If using LFS is absolutely necessary I suspect these steps will fix it (at the price of possibly losing historical commit integrity) but I'm not sure either. If I get another response from BitBucket I'll be sure to update this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: BitBucket now understands the issue and is investigating.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4</strong>: BitBucket never got back to me. I chose to start over afresh and now have a repo that works well without the problem. No idea what was going on.</p>

<p>as a result, i have a project and i want to link this project to an existing git repository.</p>

<p>1) I created a branch called perf_test, made some changes. I wanted to keep the changes in the new branch, but revert to master to check how things were. On master, I found that the changes on perf_test were showing up in the git status of master.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; git checkout -b perf_test
&gt; touch /path/to/foo.txt
&gt; git status
Uncommitted changes
modified /path/to/foo.txt
&gt; git checkout master
&gt; git status
Uncommitted changes
modified /path/to/foo.txt
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand why these changes are showing up in master after switching to master.</p>

<p>2) I then undid all changes in perf_test, and went on to make some other changes in perf_test (this was not intended - I thought I was in master but was in perf_test - but that is not important)</p>

<pre><code>&gt; git checkout perf_test
&gt; git rm /path/to/foo.txt
&gt; git status
...clean...
&gt; touch /path/to/bar.txt
&gt; git commit -am ""changed bar.txt""

...
&gt; git checkout master
&gt; git push origin master
Everything up-to-date
&gt; git push heroku master
Everything up-to-date

<p>I expect that the change to bar.txt must be pushed to origin and to heroku - but both are reporting that they are uptodate when I know that they are not (the changes never got pushed to either remote). </p>

<p>I tried to add a new feature in my app, so I created a new branch to implement this feature.<br>
After I was done I merged it to master, deleted the branch that I tested the new feature and pushed the changes to the repository (bitbucket btw).<br>
The code was normal. </p>

<p>Then I needed to add other feature tho.<br>
I then created a new branch again, but now I tested this other new feature in master, and let the other branch with the ""right"" code. </p>

<p>The new feature didn't work, so I tried going to the other branch and merging it to master, to delete the changes I made, it gave me a merge conflict tho, I tried everything, but I just wasn't able to do it.   </p>

<p>I than switched back to master and deleted the branch with the right code.<br>
I was with the wrong code in master.<br>
I hadn't pushed the changes yet, only commited, so I tried searching on how to fix this, none worked. </p>

<p>I then ran this command: <code>git checkout NUMBER OF THE COMMIT</code> </p>

<p>I checked the last pushed commit, which had the right code.   </p>

<p>My project changed to the right code, and I thought everything was ok, I thought it restored the changes. </p>

<p>I ran <code>git status</code> and that was the output:</p>

<pre><code>HEAD detached at f49fb28

modified:   Homework.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/Henrique.xcuserdatad/UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate

no changes added to commit (use ""git add"" and/or ""git commit -a"")
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran <code>git add -A</code> along with <code>git commit -m ""some message""</code> and pushed it to the repo thinking that the code would get there fixed. It didn't tho, now my repo AND project has the same code, the wrong code. Is it possible that I checkout the commit I made with the RIGHT feature, not the wrong one and my code restores to this exact commit? If not, my only salvation will be to redo everything.</p>

<p>PLEASE HELP ME!</p>

<p>This works fine when I put everything in one step, like so:</p>

<pre><code>image: node

clone:
  depth: full
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build app
        caches:

          - yarn

          - git config user.email ""&lt;email&gt;""
          - git config user.name ""&lt;name&gt;""
          - git config remote.origin.url &lt;remote ssh&gt;
          - git add .
          - git commit -m ""Add build""
          - git push
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would like to split the build process and the deploy process into separate steps. Later on, I will also add tests to the build step. </p>

<p>This is what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>image: node

clone:
  depth: full
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build app
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn
          - yarn build
    - step:
        name: Deploy to production
        deployment: production
        script:
          - git config user.email ""&lt;email&gt;""
          - git config user.name ""&lt;name&gt;""
          - git config remote.origin.url &lt;remote ssh&gt;
          - git add .
          - git commit -m ""Add build""
          - git push
</code></pre>

<p>This passes, but doesn't produce a difference on my production server (as opposed to the first way I did it above). I assumed this was because a new step would mean a new container, and that new container would thus not have access to the build I did in the previous step. </p>

<p>I tried to get around that with artifacts, but to no avail. I can't seem to find a way to get my build from the first step into the second step. </p>

<p>Anyone have any advice?</p>

<p>Whats interesting is we can go into Bitbucket, create a branch called <code>mira/testbranch</code>, run <code>git fetch</code>, run <code>git checkout mira/testbranch</code>, make a change, commit, then push... but the push will still fail with the same problem.</p>

<li>I Have two teams, one local and one remote.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Would be awesome if the local team could be able to merge from remote team code, with minimum conflicts pain.</li>

<li><p>What i have tryed?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>1th
I created a fork from the repo, and i garanted the master have only till 15th version. Some masrter and 15th branch are the some code version.
The problem in this solution: the remote team still have access to all repo and history and code.</p></li>
<li><p>2th
Create a new repo begining from 15th branch.
The problem in this case, would be about when local team do the merge from remote to local codes team.</p></li>

<li>History from Repo1 should be preserved in Repo2 (so that Repo1's commit history is present in Repo2, upto to the point of the fork)?</li>

<p>I solved the Problem with a Hint from <a href=""http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/git-howto-mirror-a-github-repository-without-pull-refs.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/git-howto-mirror-a-github-repository-without-pull-refs.html</a> by adapting the fetch refs with the following workaround.</p>

<p>I created a new bare Repository and adapted the config the following way:</p>

<pre><code>[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = true
[remote ""origin""]
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*
    fetch = +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
    url = &lt;sourceUrl&gt;
    mirror = true
    pushurl = &lt;targetUrl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I perform a Git Pull and Git Push and everything is fine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Workaround is not a beautiful solution because creating an empty bare repository and then overwriting it is weird so I want an alternative.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can add the needed fetch Configuration with ""git clone --config"" (before git clone performs it's initial fetch) but can I remove the original <code>fetch = +refs/*:refs/*</code> Configuration also with the ""git clone"" Command? This would solve the problem, that the Pull Requests are pulled initially</li>
<li>Is it possible to remove the pull requests from the bare repository after the pull? </li>
<li>Is it possible to exclude the pull requests from the push?</li>

  .git\
  B\
  C\

        CCC5\
    CC3\
  D\
  E\
</code></pre>

<p>We have a project with vendor that is outside of the firewall for collaborating on a project that involves the above 3 subdirectories of sources, CCC2, CCC3 and CCC4.  And the vendor and i would like use git for code sharing and code updates.  And we have agreed to use Bitbucket for hosting the private remote repository of codes in those 3 subdirectories.</p>

<p>Reading different approaches using git, we had come across nested git, git submodule and git subtree.  But what i'm using is neither, a crude method which involves manual merges.  In other words, i have created remote repository R2 in Bitbucket with source tree that is,</p>

<pre><code>ZZZ\         &lt;&lt;------------ root of the repository R2;
    .git\
    CCC2\
    CCC3\
    CCC4\
</code></pre>

<p>And i would have 2 local repositories, one that is tracking R1 and the other for R2.  Then the workflow is that i would git pull first then do manual/hand merges between the two local repositories, and do the necessary git push to R1 and R2 to make each other repo changes appear on the other.  Yes, crude.</p>

<p>Question i have is, is there better, simpler approach?  The team had agreed to not rely on git submodule based on all our investigation on what it takes to use submodule feature.  And use of nested git is not favorable.  So, that sort of leaves us to investigating git subtree.  Our current try with subtree isn't quite working as expected, so still learning.  </p>

<p>We had also looked at sparse checkout that creates outline of the R1 but with only the CCC2, CCC3 and CCC4 checked out.  That seem to work.  But when we push that to the Bitbucket repository R2, the R2 would be populated with all of the sources from R1.  So, something was not done right.</p>

<p>Ideally, what we would like to have is, more or less transparent pull/push between R1 and R2 remote repositories.  In other words, there would be a branch in R1 called ""vendor-work"", that will be used to pull (merge) vendor code changes from R2 to that branch, test it, and when appropriate merge into our project main/master branch.  In same token, the R2 has a branch called ""company-work"" with a pull request that the vendor will want to review before accepting the pull to their vendor working branch.  We haven't really thought about whether we need to merge repository R2's histories into R1, but the current thinking is, probably don't want the two repository histories to be merged into one, thus keeping them separate.</p>

<p>Now when I clone this repository and switch to this branch where the commits were done, the jar file is not there.</p>

<p>In the latest commit there were only changes in some java files, so the previously added jar has not been removed</p>

<p>My question is where is this jar file gone?? I can add it manually thats not the problem but I want to understand what happened and what did I wrong. Thanks</p>

<p>The problem is that in order to keep track of this code we have gotten access to a variety of different repositories and git hosting companies (like BitBucket).</p>

<p>The problem we encountered was that some code got inaccessible because some companies have disappeared over the years and this is not an optimal solution.</p>

<p>IT got asked if it was possible to backup all code that are being pushed to the various repos into our own VSTS repos. That way, we would have a copy of all the updated files whenever they are pushed to any of the repos.</p>

<p>An idea was to use a webhook but i am unsure if that is even possible for VSTS to accept incoming data pushes using webhooks from different vendors like BitBucket. It would be like mirroring between their repos and our own repos.</p>

<p>Anyone that can point me in the right direction for how to achieve this or if anyone has a different suggestion to resolve the problem at hand?</p>

Their existing CI/CD process is unconventional.  Developers create feature branches and then merge the feature branches into the develop branch <em>before</em> deploying to QA.  Then the team lead triggers a deploy of the latest code in the develop branch for QA to test.</p>
<p>My main concern is that, traditionally, the develop branch contains code that has been QA approved.  A developer will typically &quot;reverse merge&quot; the develop branch into his feature branch before committing.  A reverse merge like this is typically low/no risk since all code in the develop branch has already been QA approved.</p>
<p>So consider the following scenario for the current process being used at my organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>DeveloperX is working on Feature1 for SharedComponent</li>
<li>DeveloperY has fixed Bug1 that was blocking DeveloperX from finishing Feature1 for SharedComponent and has merged his code into the develop branch</li>
<li>DeveloperZ has implemented Feature2 for SharedComponent and has merged his code into the develop branch</li>
<li>DeveloperZ's Feature2 branch has a lot of bugs which end up breaking SharedComponent</li>
</ul>
<p>So after DeveloperX does a reverse merge of the develop branch into his Feature1 branch, he will have DeveloperY's bug fix that was needed to unblock his completion of Feature1.  But DeveloperX will now have several bugs in SharedComponent based on DeveloperZ's Feature2 branch merge into develop which has not yet been tested by QA.</p>
<p>Mature CI/CD environments are set up to avoid this type of scenario.  What are the typical types of constructs used in CI/CD environments that are used to avoid this type of scenario?  What might be some easy options for avoiding this type of scenario in my current envrionment?  Seems like Bitbucket could be configured to merge into a separate &quot;test&quot; or &quot;qa&quot; branch after PR approval.  But additional separation/granularity would be needed here as well b/c QA might say that one feature in the qa branch passes whereas another feature in the qa branch fails.</p>
<p>I'm curious about common strategies that are normally used to handle this scenario.  I normally interact in this process from a feature developer role and there are typically proper constructs in place to handle this scenario so I don't need to even think about it.  But given the setup and process of my current environment, I need to be able to make recommendations for a better and more structured process.</p>

The ultimate goal is to be able to do a diff between the files in the git repository and the files in another folder, but this question is about the way git lfs files are stored and managed locally.  I'm using SourceTree as well as command line git and have Cygwin installed (and I'm very familiar with Unix commands and development in general).</p>

<p>In my local repository (a clone of a BitBucket repository), some of them seem to be showing up with full content under the directory structure where the rest of the git files are stored.  Others are showing up as zero byte files, which I understand it some kind of pointer used by git lfs.  I also know that the <code>.git/lfs/objects/</code> folder seems to be where the local copies of some of the LFS objects are stored.</p>

<p>When I do <code>git lfs ls-files</code>, some of the files that I know are checked in to git lfs aren't listed at all (some large .mp4 video files, specifically).  I am on the latest version of the correct branch (master) where the files are checked in and visible and downloadable via the web interface.  I have tried doing <code>git lfs pull</code> and many other commands, but the files aren't showing up the way I need and expect them to.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to have a copy of the current version of the lfs files (content and all) in the same folder structure (locally) with the rest of the files.  I am fine if it is elsewhere (locally) so long as I have some way to get at it.  (I can figure out how to deal with it if I need to, so long as I have the content of the files available.)</p>

<p>So what am I missing or doing wrong?  Why can't I locate the content of some files?  Why does <code>git lfs ls-files</code> not list all the files I'm expecting it to?</p>

However when i check the local size our project is only +- 600MB in size. This is a project that has been in development for over 6 years so there are many commits ( history ) especially files like .jar viles that got added, and than back deleted to be replaced with newer versions etc. They don't exist on our current project anymore, but they are still in the git history where they take up space that isn't needed because we won't ever use them again, i'm looking for a way to remove all deleted files that don't exist in the current project and remove them completely from the git commit history ( not all files that ever got deleted ). I know that there is the 'git-filter' command to remove a file from the commit history but as far as i can see you have to specify wich file to be remove while i have no idea how many / wich files got deleted over the years in our project.</p>

<p>I don't really care about the old commits so I was hoping to delete them and start fresh.</p>
<p>I followed this approach:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13716658/how-to-delete-all-commit-history-in-github"">how to delete all commit history in github?</a></p>
<p>As per the steps in the link:</p>
<p>Checkout

<p>Add all the files
<code>git add -A</code></p>
<p>Commit the changes
<code>git commit -am &quot;commit message&quot;</code></p>
<p>Delete the branch
<code>git branch -D main</code></p>
<p>Rename the current branch to main
<code>git branch -m main</code></p>
<p>Force update your repository
<code>git push -f origin main</code></p>
<p>Then Finally
<code>git gc -- aggressive -- prune=all</code></p>
<p>This worked to clear commits from my bitbucket account but the .git folder hasn't changed size it is still 1gb. I thought git gc would clear the old files but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I have found a critical security issue in your website, which needs your attention as soon as possible, I am sending details about the issue below. Please read all the details carefully.</p>

<h1>Issue</h1>

<p>As you know the website use a git repository to store its source code, I found that the /.git endpoint is not properly handled on the website. So, the content of the git objects is visible publicly to anyone. As we can easily calculate the SHA-1 hash of the next file. with a simple script any one can download the whole source code of the website. </p>

<p>Here are some examples. </p>

<h1>Impact</h1>

<p>Any one without authorisation can download and view the whole source code of the website, and a malicious attacker could use to perform various things. Website defacement or Cryptojacking are some of them.</p>

<h1>Proof of Concept</h1>

<p>I am attaching screenshots of the source code collected, from repository as proof of concept. Please do check the attachments. </p>

<p>(The screen shot contain my website folder structure)</p>

<h1>Fix</h1>

<p>The fix is to properly lockdown /.git files on the site, it can be down by editing your .htaccess file and httpf.conf file if you use apache. </p>

<p>============================================</p>

<p>I managed to locked down the .git folder using htaccess.  I would like to ask was it the bug from Git or my repository was lacking some thing.</p>

Is there some tool that makes light work of this? I guess what I'm asking is whether there is a nice way to port over a solution from centralised TFS to bitbucket?</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I should add, I am not bothered about the commit history of this solution and the contained projects. I am happy to lose all of that - we don't even have Visual Studio on the machine, it is (at the moment) just on disk.</p>

<p>In the last couple of days a couple different developers have shown me issues with their git commits and pull requests that seem impossible.  The first one showed me a pull request, on which he had just executed a merge from his target branch to his pull request branch.  It showed one file with merge conflicts (there were 3 different files with merge conflicts) that mystified him (and me), because he had made no changes in that particular file in his pull request.  The merge conflict clearly showed the two opposing change blocks, but he had made neither of those change blocks.</p>

<p>Today, a developer showed me a situation where the contents of the file in the working tree does not reflect the content of the HEAD commit.  We saw this in the BitBucket gui view, and in our local repositories (after doing a pull).  We verified that the commit she expected to see was the last commit on the branch, but the file in the working tree simply didn't have those changes.  Again, I see the exact same symptoms when I view that file in my local repository.</p>

<p>In the BitBucket GUI, we even did a ""Diff to Previous"", and it clearly shows the latest changes that we expect to see in the working tree, but when we look at the raw file, it doesn't have those changes.</p>

<p>Is this something that happens from time to time?  What exactly has happened here, and what is a reasonable path forward?</p>

<p>I am supposed to follow this workflow. We just started with this practice, so kind of forgot. We have this JIRA &amp; Bit-Bucket. We have to create a branch from JIRA item. Then I checkout this branch locally, work on this and commit (push) to it, and make a pull request to the code reviewer, then it gets merged to the respective branch and upwards to the master.</p>

<p>I forgot to create the branch for the JIRA item. Instead, I worked and committed to my local branch say 4.10BR. I did 3 separate commits (with respect to these 3 separate JIRA items).</p>

<p>My git log says...
On branch release/4.10
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/release/4.10' by 3 commits.
  (use ""git push"" to publish your local commits)</p>

<p>Now, I would create a branch individually for these 3 items in (through) Jira-BitBucket, check these branches out, and ""move"" my commits to these branches (say b1, b2, and b3), and then push these branches.</p>

<p>However, we also frequently take in updates from the develop branch to the mini develop branch.

<p>I was wondering whether submitting a Atlassian pull request (our team uses Atlassian) would do the same as <code>git merge</code> + <code>git push</code> but with the developers having to approve the pull request before merging on the remote.

<p>Updates reflecting @ElpieKay</p>

<p>I made <code>git reset --hard</code> on the commit <code>(HEAD -&gt; development) development@{2}: filter-branch: rewrite</code> this is the commit right before the wrong merge. This solved some issues but in our ongoing pull-requests numerous conflicts arised because of the newly introduced duplicated commits.</p>

<p>So I made <code>git push origin -f ad67a5z2z8:development</code> after which the HEAD pointed to the <code>ad67a5z2z8</code> commit which is the last commit before I issued the filter-branch command. After this, the conflicts in the pull-requests are gone, but the duplicated commits are still there. I couldn't remove those no matter what.</p>
