<li>Where is develop been branched from ? fix_bug37189 ? master ? Is it a merge of the two ?</li>
<li>where has porting_bs2ws_... been branched from?</li>
<li>why fixbug_38795 box is red and it's pointed by origin/fixbug_38795?</li>  
<li>I have some problems to understand what's on master and what's on develop,
there's a clearer view or console command to understand current branching?  </li>
<li> If i'm right saying it's a mess or is it some kind of git strategy? how could i put a bit of order in it? i mean i was thinking to use rebase to move some fix branches root to develop, do i have misunderstood the use of the rebase command?

<pre><code># Ignore everything
*

# Except a couple of files in any directory
!*.pin
!*.bsh
!*/

<p>Operations on the repository (such as commit) takes several minute to carry out.  This is too long to reasonably get any work done.  I suspect that the slowdown is because git is trawling through every directory looking for files that may have been updated.  </p>

<p>There are only a few locations in the working directory where I have files that I want to track, so I tried to narrow down the set of files to examine using this query:</p>

<pre><code>*
!/version_2/analysis/abcd.pin
!/version_2/analysis/*.bsh
!*/

<p>This also works, but it is still just as slow as the less qualified gitignore.  I'm guessing it is that final line that is the killer, but no matter how I tried to make the unignore patterns be very specific, I always had to include that final wildcard clause in order for the process to find any files to commit.  </p>

<p>So my two part question is</p>

<p>1) Is there a better way to set up the gitignore file that will help speed up the commit process by only including the very narrow set of directories and file types that contain relevant results?</p>

<p>2) Is there some other tweaks to git or samba that are required to make this work more efficiently?</p>

My accounts are the creators of both repos which are discussed below (username1 created repo1 and username2 created repo2).</p>
<p>How do I configure tortoisegit to set which credentials (putty key) to use when connecting to each github repo?</p>
<p>On Tortoisegit &gt; settings &gt; Git &gt; Remote, I have repo1 configured as:</p>
<pre><code>    Remote: origin
    URL: git@github.com:username1/MyRepo1.git
    Push URL: (blank)
    Putty Key: path/to/account1.ppk
</code></pre>
<p>And repo1 configured as:</p>
<pre><code>    Remote: origin
    URL: https://github.com/username2/myRepo2.git
    Push URL: (blank)
    Putty Key: path/to/account2.ppk
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I try to push to the first repo, I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>    git.exe push --progress &quot;origin&quot; master:master
    ERROR: Permission to username1/MyRepo1.git denied to username2. &lt;-- why is username2 showing up here?!?
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
</code></pre>
<p>... why is it trying to use username2 (which is not configured anywhere on repo1) to connect? And where can I configure which username to use when connecting?</p>
<p>I tried changing the settings in Tortoisegit &gt; settings &gt; Git, to set <code>Name: username1</code> and <code>Email: user1@mydomain.com</code> but it didn't make any difference (got the same error message when trying to push).</p>
<p>I've tried to follow the explanations on the accepted answer of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41291043/tortoisegit-multiple-github-repositories-with-different-key-pairs-each"">TortoiseGit - Multiple GitHub repositories with different key pairs each</a> , however, I cannot work out what to do for any of them...</p>
<ol>
<li>Use PuTTY sessions as described in ...</li>
</ol>
<p>Well... the instructions on both links are too general to be useful. There's no concrete example to work with.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Use OpenSSH...</li>
</ol>
<p>It basically says &quot;change to 'ssh'... but that just creates new problems. How do I configure OpenSSH to make the connection? Or tell it which credentials to use for which repo? Again... no concrete examples.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Use https with...</li>
</ol>
<p>If I change the connection for repo1 to <code>https://github.com/username1/MyRepo1.git</code> then I get the error <code>fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/username1/MyRepo1.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403</code></p>
<p>So I changed it to <code>https://username1@github.com/username1/MyRepo1.git</code> and then I got a pop-up asking me to log into github. I did that as a last resort and it (seems to have) <em>worked</em>, however, I want to use the ssh keys, not login based auth.</p>
<p>So... back to the question: <strong>how do I configure TortoiseGit to use different SSH credentials to connect to different repos?</strong></p>
<p>And, for bonus points... can I configure a default set of credentials for TortoiseGit to use and then just over-ride those on a repo-by-repo basis when something different is needed? If so, how? (I ask because this seems to be what is happening unintentionally, so I wonder if there's a way to intentionally use it as a feature!)</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and thanks in advance for helping!</p>

<p>I am also using Talend Open Studio (TOS) which only really likes a single login, meaning there are internal properties on objects that change when the user is changed. Since we have multiple users doing development, we all use a single user id to run TOS which effectively eliminates the corruption we were seeing when we were trying to do it with our own user profiles. Unfortunately that makes it harder to export from TOS to the Git working copy.</p>
<p>When I create my local repository, the directories on Windows are set up to only allow me or an administrator to have write permissions on the directories. When I try to export the Talend model to the working copy, it fails because TOS is being run using the common user id.</p>
<p>All that to ask this. How can I run the git clone operation under Tortoise (or even WinGit, I have that installed as well) using the common username that I am using to run TOS?</p>

<p>I have a test automation project that requires me to work on different machines (different domains) and literally just keep both of these locations up to date... there is also a 2nd guy who just wants to keep his local repo up to date but he won't do much work on his own</p>

<p>so no different branches no merge required I just need to keep my REMOTE the single most important and up to date reference and pull the current state to my 2-3 local repos that are in different domains before working on them</p>

<p>So I just want to keep 2 or 3 local repos up to date by pulling the status from remote every time I switch machines but I don't want to mess around with merging because I don't care what the local state is I always work from the remote status
I use tortoise git as this is integrated in the automation software</p>

<p>Which commands will I ever need to work like that? I commit locally on one of the 2 machines and push the latest changes to remote, next time when I have to switch my local machine I want to just FORCEPULL the latest state to local without messing around with any merges or stuff.. just plain overwrite and keep remote my only important state</p>

<p>Additionally it would be best if I could use tortoise for the commands and not the git shell, is this possible with tortoise without firing up the commandline? </p>

<p>This is not correct. This log should be able to tell me who is the Author of Push. What I feel is that its giving correct values for users on Linux as their user name and emails are also added in the Linux user info but for windows clients its not true so their names does not appear correctly. But even if I fix names on Windows machine, this can be compromised by emulating other users name, to avoid this I don't want to rely on user names.</p>

<p>I want name provided in SSH file be appear there or name of the SSH file that was used while push to be added as Author. </p>

<p>May be git's hook pre-receive can help here but I don't know how to use it... can anybody help?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Rakesh</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for answers.</p>

<p>alexandrul, I have not set the global settings this is because I want every user's information should be logged genuinely.</p>

<p>Squelch, you are correct I can see the users who are omitting their user names but how do I enforce them to do so. I can tell them to config their local project project and set username and email address but what if some one uses fake username or tries to use someone else username and email address, basically tries to personate other?</p>

<p>That's why I thought why not to log the name of private key file, e.g. I have set file name as user1.ppk for user1 similarly user2.ppk for user2. in such cases even if someone tries to personate other they wont succeed cause key names that are used for checking will tell me the truth.</p>

<p>any ideas???</p>

<p>Regards,
Rakesh</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for help. Squelch, thanks for taking time to explain in so much of details. I think that TV's cobweb has lot of info, reading it right now.</p>

<p>As of now one thing I have done is: asked my users to use update their config to include username and email address. But I got to solve the problem as I can not chase each and user.</p>

<p>I want something like SVN+SSH where we use tunnled username in key file and it gets recorded with SVN.</p>

The repos need to be two separate entity's. This way I can easily update a client sites base code (used on multiple sites).</p>

<p><strong>Reason for two repos:</strong> I have a base php framework that my projects use. Each client gets their own repo that has the files required for that site. Due to the way git/submodules work I have to keep the ""framework"" as the master repo with the ""clients code"" as the submodule. The reason is I <em>MUST</em> have the <em>index.php &amp; .htaccess</em> (part of the framework) in the root. That's fine since my framework is designed to extend as needed. I can just put any client files I need in the ""site"" folder and store that as a separate repo. The obvious downside is in order to setup the site you have to first install the ""framework repo"" then install the ""client repo"". Since these are private this setup is fine. I also liked the benefit of being able to update my framework from another project. Trouble is now any push's I do from that clone include the ""client code"". Also since I need the same setup for my local test of the framework that submodule gets added back to the main framework repo. I thought well why not just clone the ""site"" folder that holds the ""client code"" and add that folder to the ignore list. I have to update each by hand but again thats fine. However torisegit seems to think that its now a subproject (limited support) and I cant even add that folder to the ignore list. So i'm assuming nesting git clones is bad but I could be doing it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I need to be able to deploy two repos. My ""framework"" im sure has to be the base/root repo. Then I need to embed somehow a second ""client"" repo in a folder inside the base repo. The ""client"" repo never stores the framework code, just its own code. I want to be able to update and push changes to the ""framework code"" (its alpha so lots of bug fixes) without it storing anything about the ""client code"" so I can easly just clone it into a new folder for a new site. Again client code is stored in a single folder one level up from the frameworks root. (See example below). Doing this as a git clone breaks TortoiseGit and possibly git when I try to copy paste a folder and even add it by hand to the ignore file. Adding it as a submodules adds it to the master repo so when I clone it trys to add it.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Perhaps subprojects would work but there does not seem to be much support for it and I dont understand how to use it. Im trying to keep it to major tools so that my two main tools TortoiseGit and NetBeans support everything. Perhaps there is a way to not store a submodule in the master repo but I cant find it. Maybe subfolders would work but again there does not seem to be much support for it. Seems like the simplest would be it just ignore the folder but at least TortoiseGit seems to break when I try this but I could be doing it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Example Folder Layout:</strong></p>

<pre>
-.git  (framework repo)
- system    *framework folder
-- foo   *framework folder
-- bar   *framework folder
- site  (root for second repo aka client)
-- .git  (client repo)
-- config.php   *client file
- index.php    *framework file
- .htaccess    *framework file
</pre>

<p>The ""system"" folder, index.php and .htaccess are part of the PHP framework and are generic to all my sites. The ""site"" folder holds the second repo that contains the files for that site. The second option is to rewrite my framework so that its stored in its own folder and gets called by a new index.php. However this is a major rewrite with a pathing nightmare do to the way its written. Plus the issue of dealing with the .htaccess file since that has to be in the root. Sure I could copy it but then any changes to that file would not get updated in a pull. But at this point i think its the only way.</p>

<p>Hope this makes sense. I'm out of ideas but really want to get this to work.</p>

<p>PS: I don't want to use Tortoise since, it hides the core concept/working of git. Also, my operating system is windows 7.</p>

<p>I am open to other GUI options also, provided they help me understand how git works.</p>

<p>Currently I am using Tortoise with Git extensions. Which is kind of clumsy.</p>

I am unsure exactly what to do after I've resolved conflicts after I've done a git pull. I am using tortoise GIT by the way.</p>

<p>So in most cases I can do my commits and then pull and it will automatically merge and I can proceed to push. 
However if there is a conflict, it asks me to solve the conflicts. I do that using the built in tools for tortoiseGit. Then it asks me to commit, and I get big list of every single modified file in the project.</p>

<p>Now, many of these are local changes should never be committed.. but I read this git blog: <a href=""http://randyfay.com/node/89"" rel=""nofollow"">http://randyfay.com/node/89</a> , more specifcally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One user of Tortoise Git would do a pull, have a merge conflict, resolve the merge conflict, and then look carefully at his list of files to be committed back when he was committing the results. There were lots of files there, and he knew that the merge conflict only involved a couple of files. For his commit, he unchecked all the other files changes that he was not involved in, committed the results and pushed the commit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do I know which files I must select and commit to now screw up the state of the git repository?</p>

<p>EDIT:
This sums it up nicely, something that has occured to me, we fixed but we need to understand how to prevent in the future. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When several people are committing... and I pull their work into mine,
  by default an automatic merge takes place. I have to push that merge
  commit back and not mess it up, or things go bad.</p>
  
  <p>The situation I'm describing happened when a pull with its automatic
  merge happened. Most of the merge (as usually happens) was successful.
  But one thing conflicted. The conflict was resolved. But in this case
  the developer didn't commit all the other things (that were
  successfully merged and automatically added to the index.). He only
  committed the thing that he had resolved (that he understood). He
  didn't know that he was responsible for all that other merged stuff
  that had been successfully merged and added to his index. That's the
  story of this disaster.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that a best practice is to separate the workspace from the <code>localRepository</code>.</p>

<p>So with tortoiseGit, I create a bare repo ""<code>localRepo.git</code>"".
I also created separated ""<code>workspace</code>"" and ""<code>workspace2</code>"" directories. In each one, I cloned the repo.</p>

<p>It is a big project and switching a branch and recompiling everything takes too long. This is why I want to have two (or more) working trees corresponding to two branches of the Subversion project.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible to share the .git folder for the two working trees (its 5GB), or I need to clone the repository or maybe checkout it again from subversion (it took several hours).</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-as-a-Client"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""git book"">git book</a> it seems that interaction between two git repositories will not work well if they interact with svn as well (I don't know if this applies to my case):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don’t push to a parallel Git repository to collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time. Subversion can have only a single linear history, and confusing it is very easy. If you’re working with a team, and some are using SVN and others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate – doing so will make your life easier.</p>

<p>The ugly effect is that the Windows user tries to push and gets a ""you must pull"" message, but then tries to pull and gets a merge conflict due to the not-really-modified LFS file. However, there is no resolve... option in the tortoisegit dropdown for the supposed conflict. A revert sets the icon back to unmodified, but any tortoisegit action still fails as though the lfs file has been modified and resets the icon status to modified.</p>

<p>Since the user can't push, can't pull, and can't resolve a merge conflict that's causing the inability to push or pull, the user is stuck.

/Assets/Editor/PluginA/*
/Assets/Plugins/PluginA/*

<p>PluginB</p>

/Assets/Editor/PluginB/*
/Assets/Plugins/PluginB/*

<p>Now, I would like to be able to isolate a folder (let's call it ""resources"") which will hold some resource files such as graphics, scripts, sounds which are not really crucial to the coders on the project. The coders must not be able to pull from or synch with this folder.</p>

<p>However, another team should be able to manipulate this ""resources"" folder and make changes to it, while also being able to receive the changes made by the coders.</p>

<p>I understand that there is an ignore function that creates a .gitignore list. But as I understand it, this list will ignore files/folders across all users so nobody will effectively be able to access the ""resources"" folder as soon at it's defined to be ignored.</p>

<p>Another way would be to branch the ""origin"" into a ""coders"" branch and ""resources"" branch. Then the ""coders"" would push and pull to/from remote ""coders"", push to (but never pull from) ""origin"" and also never push to ""resources"". ""Resources"" would always pull/push to and from ""origin"" but never to ""coders"".</p>

<p>I suspect this process would really need some kind of a ""push to specific list of branches"" option.</p>

<p>I have seen the other questions on StackOverflow but none of them work. However, I did try many things so hopefully this extra information can help find a solution.</p>

<p>I set up Bonobo Git Server using IIS and http without SSL certificates and everything works fine. I can push/pull large files with TortoiseGit, GitExtensions and also use Visual Studio 2015 Community. Obviously this is insecure without encryption.</p>

<p>The problem arises when I set up Bonobo using https and SSL certificates. I created the CA and Server certificate using makecert and pvk2pfx and installed the certificates in Windows store. The website works fine and I can pull and push small changes. However, when I try to push a large file it hangs at the message POST git-receive-pack even when using Git GUI. But Visual Studio 2015 Community will work fine! Once I push using VS I can then use Git to pull those changes on another computer. This leads me to believe it is an issue with Git and not the Bonobo server.</p>

<p>The things I had to do was add the SSL key to bundle.crt and set postBuffer = 524288000. I also tried sslVerify = false to test for an SSL issue but this did not work. I also tried turning off my Windows Firewall.</p>

<p>Is this an issue with Git and SSL? Is there something else that needs to be set up? I'm new to Git and trying to get this working for a few days now. Using Visual Studio is a workaround for now but it would be nice to be able to use other Git clients directly in Windows. I have the latest version of Git, 2.7.0, and I believe when I tried GitExtensions it installed a pre release version, I think 1.9</p>

<p>In most cases, they affect different files. However, there is <strong>one file that contains changes for both changesets</strong> which break the build if pushed without the second changeset. Too bad I want to work on that on a separate branch until functional. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to edit my commit such that I can extract the changes affecting changeset 2?</strong> </p>

<p>In Mercurial, you could untangle commits by</p>

<ol>
<li>converting them to patches, </li>
<li>opening them in a text editor and </li>
<li>moving lines of diff between the patch files (if your Mercurial GUI was not open at the time). </li>
</ol>

<p>When the GUI was reopened, the patches contained what they were supposed to, could be finalized and pushed.</p>

<p>That's actually the workflow I am aiming for. Is there anything similar for git? </p>

<p>Tools I am using: TortoiseGit and GitExtensions on Win10</p>

<p><strong>Edit: solution as suggested in the answer</strong></p>

<pre><code>git checkout new_branch
git reset -p HEAD~1
git add -p
...
git commit -m ""my changeset 1""
git add
git commit -m ""my changeset 2""
git checkout old_branch
git reset --hard &lt;new_branch&gt;~1

<p>So my question is this: what hooks (if any) are called when a submodule is updated?  It seems like post-checkout might be what I want but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>We're using TortoiseGit with Git for Windows(msysgit) as the backend if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>takes the position that TortoiseGit's main function is <strong>not</strong> to eliminate the need for the git command line, and in general, I agree.</p>

<pre><code>git.exe pull -v --progress      ""origin""
fatal: 'pull' appears to be a git command, but we were not
able to execute it. Maybe git-pull is broken?
git did not exit cleanly (exit code 128)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand, why just the <code>pull</code> command is not working .. thanks for any help.</p>

<p>I can make a clone of the repository, with the contributed changes .. but can not <code>Pull</code> the changes to created repository on my PC.</p>

I try to achieve the following, but wasn't able to and didn't find solutions on the web yet:
2 branches: master and daily-backups
daily-backups as the name implies should store a daily status.
The master branch however should not contain all commits of the daily-backups branch after merging, but only milestones.
So I wanted to have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>Master:         m1 - - - - - - - - m2 - - - - - m3...
daily-backups:    \- b1 - b2 - b3 /  \- b4 - b5 /

<p>I tried it with the activated squash option in the TortoiseGit Merge command.
After commiting this to the repo I got the following:</p>
<pre><code>Master:         m1 - - - - - - - - stashed-commit
daily-backups:    \- b1 - b2 - b3   
</code></pre>
<p>but b3 isn't &quot;linked&quot; to the stashed-commit, although they contain identical code.
Is there a way to achieve this?
Also this seems a bit messy, as when I try to use daily-backups afterwards. I get an merge conflict at the next merge into the master branch.</p>
<p>I already tried doing a normal merge (without stashed option) afterwards, but this includes all
daily-backup commits into the master branch.</p>

<p>and uploaded the public key along with a new entry for the repo and the new user in the config file to gitolite-admin repo.</p>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>The developer is using **** along with <strong>putty</strong> to connect to the server, which is running <strong>git</strong> on a <em>non-standard</em> port and he keeps on getting the same error over and over again:</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>In the meantime, we managed to <code>git clone</code> the repository by addressing it with the <code>ssh://</code> protocol instead of <code>git://</code>, so it doesn't seem like it is a problem of the rsa_public.key or something like that.</p>

<p>The iptables on the server are accepting connections through the port for git, but it keeps on giving the above mentioned error.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>it will solve the problem, so I committed it to Github and then tried to download the txt file again, but it still don't show the line breaks.</p>

<p>What else can be done? how can I be certain that Github is using the <code>.gitattributes</code> that I added? cause it don't seem to use it.</p>

<hr>

<p>To solve that issue I ended up adding <code>.gitattributes</code> file to the root folder of the project with this content:</p>

<pre><code># Windows-only files
*.txt text eol=crlf
</code></pre>

<p>But this only handle the problem in Github, I use <code>Github</code> and also <code>TeamCity</code> 
So when I downloaded the text file through <code>TeamCity</code>, the file EOL was not set to <code>CRLF</code>
in <code>TeamCity</code> this checkbox need to be checked also (its in the VCS):

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong><br>
I have just changed the git.exe path in tortoise settings (settings/general/git.exe path). It what set to <em>C:\Program Files\Git\bin\libexec\git-core</em>. I change it to <em>C:\Program Files\Git\bin</em>.<br>
And it works again.
There is 4 directories with git.exe :</p>

I have both a laptop and desktop that I have been using to practice git locally using the command line. On my laptop I have installed git and tortoise git and have only changed git settings to utilize notepad++ as the default editor and set core.autocrlf=true. Everything is working fine on the laptop and am able to run the application which is tecnomatix plant simulation. Whereas on the desktop, I have only installed git and not tortoise git, made the same setting changes as was done on the laptop but also I messed with the .gitattributes file and ran these methods in the cmd line:</p>
<p>git rm --cached -r</p>
<p>git reset --hard</p>
<p>I read somewhere else that the first line above will delete the file. Not sure if this is true since the .gitattributes file is still listed in the repository, however the icon of the .gitattributes file has changed from standard .txt file icon to .txt file icon with a green chart and a pencil. Anyways I am unable to run the application on my desktop and believe the reason is due to changes I made with the .gitattributes files. Appreciate any clarification anyone may have on this.</p>
