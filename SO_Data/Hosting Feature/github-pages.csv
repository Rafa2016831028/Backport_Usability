I have the most updated version of gh-pages.</p>

<p>I expected my page to have normal <hr> tags to divide the sections of my pages, and normal spacings with (<br>).However the output after I deploy it makes the <hr> tag huge with different colors which messes up the look of the page, and the spaces are all much larger, making the whole layout messed up.</p>

<p>I started by creating a GitHub repository for each class, and setting up a corresponding project page.

<p>I also tried using Jekyll collections to handle this, but it seems like you can't create nested collections. I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37277738/can-i-create-nested-collections-in-jekyll"">this</a> related question for a pseudo-workaround, but it requires me to store all of my notes in a single directory, which I'm reluctant to do.</p>

<pre><code>1. Create a folder named templates in your MkDocs project, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Inside the templates folder, create a new file named custom_notebook.html.
3. In the custom_notebook.html file, extend the base.html template and override the content block with your AdSense code:

{% extends &quot;base.html&quot; %}

{% block content %}
  &lt;!-- Google AdSense Code --&gt;
 ...(I put mt google adsense code here. Didn't include it here for a security reason)
  &lt;!-- End Google AdSense Code --&gt;

  &lt;!-- Render the notebook content --&gt;
  {{ super() }}
{% endblock %}

4. Update the mkdocs.yml configuration file to use the custom template:
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocs-jupyter:
      exclude: .ipynb_checkpoints
      template: templates/custom_notebook.html

<p>Other repos that I have checked that deployed on Github pages used the base variable in the vite config file and I assume that's what makes the loading of images possible but mines just throws an error.</p>

<p>and then added a <code>&lt;img src={tree} /&gt;</code> and this works, but I don't get why it doesn't work when I use a string as the path directly in the img tag. If I have to do it this way then I will have a bunch of import statements at the top and I don't really think that is a great solution.</p>

       allData &amp;&amp; allData?.map((data) =&gt; {

<p>When i load site with : &quot;user.github.io/reponame&quot;, the route does not match with any of the route in app.js. It gives 404 page.. But technically react-router or react should handle this while bundling, using the homepage property.. But it does not. It only works for static files..</p>
<p>And when i click on any of the links the base url changes to &quot;user.github.io/&quot;..
When i click on Hone i.e &quot;/&quot; it should redirect to &quot;user.github.io/reponame/&quot; instead it redirects to &quot;user.github.io/&quot;..
Same way when i click on /photography it should redirect to &quot;user.github.io/reponame/photography&quot; instead it redirects to &quot;user.github.io/photograophy&quot; which again gives 404 page...</p>
<p>How can i make react router replace all urls with respect to base url (for routing) ? I don't want to hard-code routes..</p>
<p>PS. I also have nested routes.</p>
<p>I tried using %PUBLIC_URL%. But did not work.</p>

<p>Initially, paths was set ‘/’ or ‘./’ which caused navigation to use either norricorp.github.io/about(does not exist) or norricorp.github.io/sveltekit/about/about (same again). But navigation does now work with the above values but no formatting.</p>

<p>I have cleared the browser cache. I have also created another github pages project under a different account so that it was a top level domain. Same result.</p>
<p>So the browser is looking in the right place, the files are there in the correct branch of the github repo but the browser is not finding them. Is github pages not serving these?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The important part is the <code>no implicit conversion of Jekyll::GitHubMetadata::Value into String (TypeError)</code> section. It seems that somewhere the metadata gem is putting a custom object where the redirect gem expects there to be a string, and as a result it explodes.</p>

<p>If I remove all instances of anything referencing <code>site.github.*</code>, the error still occurs. But if I remove all <code>redirect_from</code>s, the error goes away and it builds successfully. I don't know enough about Ruby or either of these gems to do much troubleshooting past that. It looks like the culprit is <a href=""https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from/blob/master/lib/jekyll-redirect-from/redirector.rb#L68"" rel=""nofollow"">this line</a> of <code>redirector.rb</code> in the Jekyll-redirect-from gem.</p>

<p>I have a repro site (very loose definition of ""site"") at <a href=""https://github.com/WasabiFan/curly-parakeet"" rel=""nofollow"">WasabiFan/curly-parakeet</a>. It throws the above error on both Windows and a fresh Ubuntu VM.</p>

<p>What might the problem be? Is there something that must be fixed in one of these gems?</p>

<p>P.S. As a result of this question, I have found a use for GitHub's suggested repo names. Thank you.</p>

<p>and then tried <code>git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages</code> again but got the same error as before.</p>

<p>At the Yeoman deployment page I see under the <strong>Some common errors</strong> section </p>

  <p>You might get an error like this Updates were rejected because the tip

<p>I am apprehensive to force the <code>subtree push</code> because I am new to git in general and not sure what is going to be destroyed. I mean, I currently do not have a <code>gh-pages</code> branch at my maxmythic_angular <code>origin</code> remote so I am not worried about that but I have my <code>master</code>, <code>gh-pages-old</code> and <code>gh-pages-v1</code> branches there. Will they be destroyed if I run <code>git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages</code>? </p>

<p>I went ahead and copied my work to another folder to be safe and I added <code>--force</code> to my <code>git subtree push</code> command and ran it. This is what I got </p>

<ul>
<li>github offers github pages to host documentation in either a folder on my <code>master</code> branch or a dedicated <code>gh-pages</code> branch, but that would mean to commit build artifacts</li>
<li>I can also let <code>readthedocs</code> build and host docs for me through webhooks, but that means learning how to configure Yet Another Tool at a point in time where I try to consolidate everything related to my project in <code>github-actions</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I already have a docu-building process that works for me (using <code>sphinx</code> as the builder) and that I can also test locally, so I'd rather just leverage that instead. It has all the rules set up and drops some static <code>html</code> in an artifact - it just doesn't get served anywhere. Handling it in the workflow, where all the other deployment configuration of my project is living, feels better than scattering it over different tools or github specific options.</p>

I've been trying to look at all other example github project pages I could find and even the blogs but none exhibit the problems I am getting. First, I am trying to create a project page for my repo. I did this by following the usual tutorials, creating a gh-pages branch in my project repo and pushing.</p>

<p>I managed to do these and template my files. I even managed to use HAML and SASS(they still both get converted to html/css and that's what I push to the repo so no problem there). I just think that I am configuring my jekyll wrong. First, I don't see any configurations in other people's pages that use baseurl or url on config.yml.</p>

<p>The problem with mine is when looping through my posts:</p>

<pre><code>{% for post in site.posts %}
  &lt;a href=""{{ post.url }}""&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>It always generates the href as <code>href=""/post-title""</code></p>

<p>my <code>_config.yml</code> btw only has this:</p>

<pre><code>permalink: /exercises/:title
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this when I click the link, it always points to <a href=""http://corroded.github.com/exercises/title-here"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://corroded.github.com/exercises/title-here</a> when it should actually be <a href=""http://corroded.github.com/projectname/exercises/title-here"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://corroded.github.com/projectname/exercises/title-here</a></p>

<p>I have actually tried hard coding the path by doing:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""http://corroded.github.com{{ post.url }}""&gt;</code> and this works. It goes to the post BUT it shows it as plain text and not as the generated html. I know I am missing something very simple here but I can't seem to find it and I've been wrestling with this the whole weekend. </p>

<p>Oh and I forgot to add: doing this in my localhost, I can access everything at:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost:4000/</code> and clicking on links will get me to <code>http://localhost:4000/exercises/title-here</code> and IT WORKS. So I have a pretty good guess that it has something to do with the configuration.</p>

Even with a brand new blazor project I have had no success. I consistently hit 404 errors with an unmodified new project, following the instructions people have given on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54260158/properly-publishing-deploying-a-blazor-project-to-github-pages"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>You can find my current attempt at <a href=""https://billybillyjim.github.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://billybillyjim.github.io</a> and the repro is at <a href=""https://github.com/billybillyjim/billybillyjim.github.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/billybillyjim/billybillyjim.github.io</a></p>

<p>My current process has been this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a brand new Client-side Blazor page in Visual Studio 2019 Preview (3.0.100-preview6-012264). </p></li>
<li><p>Go to Github Pages and create a repo named billybillyjim.github.io</p></li>
<li><p>Clone the repo to a local folder using the Desktop Github app.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the Publish option in the Build menu of VS2019 I select a folder profile.</p></li>
<li><p>After a successful build I move the files created from the published folder to the repo folder.</p></li>
<li><p>I commit and push to github.</p></li>
<li><p>I add a .nojekyll file, and add the SPA javascript scripts to both a new 404.html and to the index.html.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trying to load the page gives me a 404.
""Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()""
This error is for every dll file.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<p>Putting everything in a folder, changing the base href in index.html, and setting the SPA script segmentCount to 1.</p>

<p>Removing underscores and updating the file references in index and the two blazor.js files.</p>

<p>Changing the href in index.html to to the repo name as described at the end of <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/blazor/client-side?view=aspnetcore-3.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">the instructions here.</a></p>

<p>I've compared my setup to the example page at <a href=""https://github.com/blazor-demo/blazor-demo.github.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/blazor-demo/blazor-demo.github.io</a> has a very similar setup to mine, but it's a year old and seems to use a very different set of dlls and a different blazor.js.</p>

<p>I am entirely new to web development, so I think it's very likely I am completely misunderstanding something simple.</p>

<p>And It works well but I have some problem with re-deploy the app When the source code are change.</p>

<p>It seems that I have to commit gh-pages branch but I usually commit to master branch and when I commit to master branch, nothing happens in Github Pages.</p>

<p>So I thought if I just type <code>npm run deploy</code> in console it will works, but it's not.</p>

<p>And I found the solution that Remove gh-pages branch and deploy again and it works. But I want to find easier solution to re-deploy my reactjs app to github.</p>

I have been updating and pushing my commits to git over the last week.  No problem.</p>

<p>I now want to add a gitpage to summarise the problem so that people don't have to go through my code.</p>

<p>I tried to set this up in /docs, but it wouldn't work.  It only worked when I used the master branch, and only when I used readme.md which I would have guessed is bad practise.... This would be a nice to have if possible.  If not, I will create another documentation file in the docs file.</p>

<p>What I do not understand, is that when I created the page, it adjusted the readme.md on github.  A config file has also been added.
When I then run git status in bash to then update my local files, it tells me that the ""Branch is up to date with origin/master""</p>

<p>I tested if I add another doc on local and go through the steps to push it up (status/ add . /commit/push origin master), and it told me there were differences.</p>

<p>I tried git pull, and it told me there was a merge.mng file that was duplicated.  I deleted one.  In bash, it now wants me to write a message about why the merge is necessary... which in theory is fine but I don't seem to be able to enter/submit that message.</p>

I'm trying to embed a video in a page that is stored in my static files, but having trouble. The url to the video itself works fine, with sound and controls functioning. The video is just under 2MB, and saved in mp4 format in my static folder. I'm getting no errors or warnings in console, which is also making this harder to debug.</p>
<p>I'm reading a lot that markdown doesn't support video embeds, but have tried a lot of the 'workarounds' I'm finding on here.</p>
<pre><code>![video](filename.mp4) and ![video](www.hostedurl.etc)
</code></pre>
<p>However, using both of the above works in Safari (silently, with no video controls - more like a gif), but just doesn't show up in Chrome. Various html  tags don't work on either no matter what I put in them it seems. Also doesn't work trying to use iframe and link to the video on youtube doesn't work either.</p>
<p>When I say 'doesn't work' here I mean it just fails to show at all. When control is put in the video tag, I get a blank video player that is completely unresponsive, and grey where the video should be. In this instance, the isn't the most important thing - would be great to have the silent looping I'm seeing on Safari show up on Chrome also. But I would ideally like it to work with sound too obviously - if not on this page, there are some other sound files I'd like to embed into the pages somehow.</p>
<p>Am I missing something? Is there some sort of plug-in that I should be using alongside this?</p>

<p>Now if I go to mobile version of deployed project, it practically doesn't work. The images that were loaded with gatsby-img have their blurred lines (not sure how to describe this loading effect) but they never fully load. Every single functionality that used useState() hook does not function at all and all buttons that have prevent defaults on them actually refresh the browser.</p>

It works fine, but I would like to add links for each image in the slider. The links to go specific posts.</p>
<p>I added <code>url</code> to the data file. With references to post names used in full url path:</p>
<pre><code>carousels:
  - images: 
    - image: /assets/images/image-1.jpg
      url: post-name-1
    - image: /assets/images/image-2.jpg
      url: post-name-2
    - image: /assets/images/image-3.jpg
      url: post-name-3
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure how to get those links into the carousel <code>_include</code>.
I've tried adding a href that prepends with the <code>site.baseurl</code>, a separate for loop and various other approaches, but I feel like I'm just not seeing the right way. And I think it's probably simple, but I don't have the experience. Any advice to put me on the right path appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>I added relative URL and got a link to work for the first image by wrapping the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> with the href:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;ul&gt;
      {% for item in site.data.carousels.carousels[number].images %}

      &lt;/a&gt;
     {% endfor %}
   &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But the next images don't display. Adding the href before or after the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> doesn't work at all.</p>

<p>I want to create a github pages website which a user can navigate to and see a prettified version of the <code>machine_friendly.csv</code> file. The problem is that github's CORS doesn't allow me to directly download the file. For example, this doesn't work:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>React.useEffect(() =&gt; {

Status code: 302.

<p>Is there <em>any</em> way of getting around this? I've tried uploading the file to a pastebin as well as to the github release, but none of the pastebins I've tried enable CORS for free. I've also tried some CORS proxies, but they either take too long or just don't work anymore. I also tried using github's API, but that also gives CORS problems.</p>
<p>Is there a service online that I can upload my small (&lt;1MB) file to and download it later via javascript?</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?
Can someone help please.
Is my index.html not created accurately?
Am I missing some step within GA4. I thought all I had to do was put in this code beneath the head and body and it would reflect in the data collected.</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<pre><code>Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
Learn More

You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.

<p>the steps I followed was:</p>
<ol>
<li>run the <code>yarn build</code> command,</li>
<li>copied the build folder to the gh-pages branch</li>
<li>erased the src folder and deployed to github.</li>
<li>automatically the page was configured on github pages to be served from gh-pages branch but was shown the above md instead my app.</li>

<p>this is my index.js</p>
<p>I tried to change the homepage, but I think it's correct as I can see the source of index.hmtl, but the app doesn't get rendered.</p>
<p>Those are the error I'm getting in the console:</p>

<p>So from the error, I understand that it's trying to get the source from:</p>

<p>While the correct URL should be:</p>

<p>Strange things on my personal github, I get the correct path when I deploy, only on github enterprise the URLs get deployed wrong.</p>
<p>How can I fix that?</p>

<p>I'm using the desktop GitHub, I'm not using Git right now (but also the tutorial guy wasn't and it worked easily) and pushing my local repositories to my online github, and it worked. There are four repos and all of them are public. Yet, when I go to my username.github.io there is nothing, it doesn't exist, that's one thing to fix.</p>
<p>Do I have to create some file? I don't understand, there are youtube videos that say you have to choose a theme, but it's been updated I guess because the website it's not like that anymore, and it doesn't show me themes or anything like that.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of youtube videos and done exactly what they have done, i've read the github guidelines but i think they are confusing, but i tried a lot of different things. If it makes any difference, my repositories only have like .html and css files (plus the images, fonts, html and css stuff). I don't know anything other than hmtl and css yet, not even javascript, so that's it.</p>
<p>So I don't know how to proceed, I've extinguished my completly amateur resources by doind this post, and I'm learning by myself so I have no one to help me here. Also, since I've never had any contact with github, im just &quot;github dumb&quot;, I don't know how branchs work, I'm sorry, I know what a branch is, but somehow that plataform makes it hard.</p>

<p>which I got from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36782614/19465528"">here</a> which normally works. but then today I added a new folder inside it called <code>tictactoe</code> which only got HTML and JS file and using <code>../style.css</code> from previous directory then I got this <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5g0K2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">error</a> which says <code>updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote counterpart. check out this branch and integrate the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.</code>.</p>
<p>I tried various solution from this site such as</p>
<pre><code>git push -f origin gh-pages
</code></pre>
<p>from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/62603479/19465528"">here</a> but it says <code>Everything up-to-date</code> then I tried pull using <code>git pull -f origin gh-pages</code> but it says <code>fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories</code> so I tried <code>git pull origin gh-pages --allow-unrelated-histories</code> from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/62603479/19465528"">here</a> which happens it actually pull but I still can't push the subtree normally and receives the same error as this title.</p>

When run locally, it works perfectly but once it is pushed to github/deployed, the token is removed when I check my facebook developers account. Anyone know how to fix this? Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>add a backend which is located in my root folder (not src) which is used to get the data like so:</p>
<pre><code>app.get('/insta', (req, res) =&gt; {
  axios.get(`https://graph.instagram.com/me/media?fields=id,media_type,media_url,caption&amp;limit=12&amp;access_token=${process.env.REACT_APP_INS_TOKEN}`)
    .then((response) =&gt; {
      res.json(response.data)
    }).catch((error) =&gt; {
      console.log('error', error)
    })
})
</code></pre>
<p>I made sure to save the token in a .env file which is also located in my root folder.
I added .env to my gitignore file
This is how I connect the front end to the back end if it helps</p>
<pre><code>  const [feeds, setFeedsData] = useState([])
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const options = {
      method: 'GET',
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/insta'
    }
    async function fetchInstagramPost() {

      axios
        .request(options)
        .then((response) =&gt; {
          // console.log(response.data)
          setFeedsData(response.data)
        }).catch((error) =&gt; {
          console.log('error', error)
        })
    }
    fetchInstagramPost();
  }, [])

Locally it works.</p>
<p>I've seen people suggest changing from <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code> but that didn't help. I've also seen, and even used, a solution for <code>create-react-app</code> or <code>webpack</code> where you add some code to the <code>index.html</code> file in the <code>public</code> directory as well as a <code>404.html</code> but the issue is <code>vite</code> has a different file structure.</p>
<p>Where would I put them in a <code>vite</code> application where there's nothing in the <code>public</code> directory. It does have a <code>dist</code> folder with an <code>index.html</code> but I'm not sure if that's the one.</p>
<p>Not sure what code I would need to show, but here's my <code>main.jsx</code> and <code>App.jsx</code> files:</p>
<pre><code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Header /&gt;
      &lt;div className=&quot;app&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Routes&gt;
          &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Home /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path=&quot;/example&quot; element={&lt;Example /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;/Routes&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );

<pre><code>
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;)).render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);

</code></pre>
<p>Again, locally this works, and when deploying to <code>gh-pages</code> the root or home page work, but no extended routes. Like I said, I had a similar issue with <code>webpack</code> but the solution I got there didn't work since <code>vite</code> has different file structure so I was unsure how to add the correct files.</p>
<p>EDIT: I've also seen a github <a href=""https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/9201"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">issue</a> where a user had a similar issue and the solution was to define routes in the <code>vite.config.js</code> but again the difference there is that user had multiple <code>index.html</code> files for each component/route. I just have the standard <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> situation wrapping my routes.</p>

<p>I have a git repo in the <code>/public</code> folder but the contents of the <code>/static</code> folder are not a part of the repository. Therfore they are not uploaded to the <code>username.github.io</code> page. </p>

<p>the <code>/static</code> folder contains images and css files. This is why my page does not look good after pushing to github.</p>

<p>My workaround is that each time I manually copy the <code>/static</code> folder into the <code>/public</code> folder after I build the site. </p>

<p>I think there should be  a better solution and I am probably missing something in the <code>config.toml</code> file of the hugo workflow. </p>

<p>Naturally, when I add a <code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code> to WEBSITE.git, the gh-pages <code>http(s)://&lt;user&gt;.github.io/WEBSITE/</code> website works but doesn't have the audios. All as we can expect.</p>

<p>I need the audios to works, the easy way would be to integrate fully these audios to WEBSITE.git.

It matters since I'am teaming up with a dev who have very low internet connection.</p>

I got :</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Tried to create a gh-pages locally then push again.
<strong>Only show README.md.</strong></p>

<p>Did I do something wrong? The gh-pages was successfully created once no drama by running &quot;npm run deploy&quot; before. So I don't understand what's wrong.
Any idea will be much appreciated.</p>

For example: /site/jacoco/.resources/report.css</p>

<p>When I publish this to my pages.github.com site (using site-maven-plugin), everything is there in my special Github branch (gh-pages).</p>

<p>However, I'm getting 404's when trying to access resources that are in folders with a preceding . (dot) in the folder name.</p>

<p>A simplified example:<br>
<a href=""https://github.com/justinhrobbins/FlashCards_App/blob/gh-pages/test/.resources/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/justinhrobbins/FlashCards_App/blob/gh-pages/test/.resources/index.html</a></p>

<a href=""http://justinhrobbins.github.io/FlashCards_App/test/.resources/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://justinhrobbins.github.io/FlashCards_App/test/.resources/index.html</a></p>

<p>However, if I remove the . (dot) from the folder name it works fine:<br>
<a href=""https://github.com/justinhrobbins/FlashCards_App/blob/gh-pages/test/resources/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/justinhrobbins/FlashCards_App/blob/gh-pages/test/resources/index.html</a><br>

<p>So I'm assuming pages.github.com doesn't support preceeding dot in the folder name (and Googling shows using a preceeding dot may not be a recommended practice anyway) but would appreciate confirmation.</p>

<p>Edit: FYI - when i publish similar to Tomcat it works even with folders with preceeding dot in name</p>

&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""ward9250.github.io/HybRIDS/css/custom.css"" type=""text/css""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However if this is in the homepage it does not load correctly formatted with any of the settings or styles of bootstrap or my custom modifications and overrides.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I fix this so all my pages, no matter where they are can see my stylesheets.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Ben.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I've just found something strange - if I set my HTML to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href=""/HybRIDS/css/bootstrap.css"" rel=""stylesheet""&gt;
&lt;link href=""/HybRIDS/css/bootstrap-responsive.css"" rel=""stylesheet""&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/HybRIDS/css/custom.css"" type=""text/css""/&gt;

<p>I really don't know what's wrong and i'm kinda lost, i did follow all the steps but i think i got mixed up in the order a bit.</p>

<p>I know Github Pages looks for an index.html in root to display on the page but npm run build creates a new folder with a compiled index.html. If anyone can help, i'd be very grateful, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>What I've Tried</strong></p>

<p>Following <a href=""https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Gatsby docs</a>, I ran <code>npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code>, and added a custom deploy script to my <code>package.json</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>`{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""deploy"": ""gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -b master""
  }
}`
</code></pre>

<p>After I added that script I ran <code>npm run deploy</code>. Results posted at the end of this post.</p>

<p>There were no issues with running <code>gatsby build</code>, so I tried running <code>gh-pages</code> expecting to see something, but it says command not found.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42308879/npm-err-code-elifecycle"">this post</a> and ran <code>npm cache clean --force</code>, deleted <code>node_modules</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code>, and ran <code>npm install</code> again. </p>

<p>I've been searching around for similar questions for a while now. Got any ideas? This is my first post here, please go easy on me...</p>

<p>Is it even possible to host this app on github pages? Do I need to modify my project in some way to make it work? Also - I know I will have to change the mongoose database pointer for the database portion to work. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!</p>

It acts as a nice documentation for my code in the <code>master</code> branch. However I now want it to also render a <strong>custom html page</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What do I mean by that?</strong><br />
The html is a completely finished page that <strong>doesn't need a template</strong> but still needs to be output.</p>
<p>Usually we write in markdown and Github takes care of everything. But this custom html file can't be prepared that way. It has some interactive elements, scripts etc that can't be put down in markdown and expected to be prepared correctly by Github (OR is it actually possible to hack the template to do that?). I don't really care the endpoint of the page, it can be any thing.</p>

<p>Here's the reason:</p>

<p>I'd like to use GitHub pages to publish project documentation. Unfortunately, GitHub insists that the site content be in a branch named ""gh_pages"". The trouble with this is that I have to switch branches whenever I want to write documentation, so I can't code and write at the same time. Also, Eclipse freaks out when I switch to the gh_pages branch because there's no .project file there, so the whole project closes.</p>

<p>A better way would be to store site content in a /gh_pages subdirectory in the master branch. It would be very cool if I could just edit a few markdown pages there, commit and push, and have to site be updated automagically.</p>

<p>Possible?</p>

<p>Background: I have made test project with angular2 on github(<a href=""https://github.com/SomePeaceStudio/manatelpa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/SomePeaceStudio/manatelpa</a>). I was testing how to build project with webpack and then uglify it for production.</p>

<pre><code>GET localhost:8080/index.html
GET localhost:8080/app.js
GET localhost:8080/angular.png
</code></pre>

<p>and so on.. and it works like a magic.</p>

<p>When I push my 'dist' folder to gh-pages branch <a href=""https://github.com/SomePeaceStudio/manatelpa/tree/gh-pages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/SomePeaceStudio/manatelpa/tree/gh-pages</a> (I'm using gh-pages for project) so the path to my page would be:

in this case it loads index.html from </p>

<p>but it tries to get rest of my project from</p>

<p>I do not know how to deal with this problem.. I even do not know how to correctly title it to do some googling.. </p>

<p>Should I change the way how content is loaded on my index.html page (it does it automatically) if so how to force it to load all my content from baseurl/manatelpa/.. . I search for some elegant solution, if there is one.</p>

<p>I can visit the website via gitpages fine. I can see my two test posts. But i updated the navigation file within the source folder and tried to push this but it doesn't seem to appear. </p>

<p>In the tutorial there is a bit: </p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git commit -m ""I made a post."" -a
$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't do anything for me. It says:</p>

<pre><code>Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>

<p>Even when i am sure it's not.. Can anyone save a damsel in distress?</p>

<p>Note - I don't see any of the commit comments on my repo, so i am figuring something has gone wrong and my master is not correct.</p>

<pre><code>---
title: something

<li>the suffix gets changed to <code>.html</code></li>

<li>can I import css files?</li>

<p>Is there a way to conditionally delete a remote branch using <code>git push origin :gh-pages</code> where the command is skipped or ignored if the gh-pages branch doesn't exist?</p>
<p><strong>The long version of my question:</strong></p>
<p>I'm building a boilerplate / starter template for using NPM as a Build System or Workflow for building basic webpages (instead of using something like Grunt or Gulp). The project uses a <code>/build</code> folder and I wanted to use Github Pages to serve the contents of <code>/build</code>. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do that from /settings (I only see /root, not /build), so I ran across this command:</p>
<p><code>git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages</code></p>
<p>Which creates a <code>gh-pages</code> branch and pushes my changes from the <code>/build</code> folder of my master branch to the newly created <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Excellent!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't simply update my <code>gh-pages</code> branch with changes (nor would I want to). I also can't make changes in <code>master</code> and then merge them into <code>gh-pages</code>. I get lots of error messages with branches being unrelated, or out of sync, or whatever.</p>
<p>Instead I need to make the changes in <code>master</code> and then use the <code>git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages</code> command again to push those changes. But I run into another error where it doesn't want to push new changes into an existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
<p>Okay ... So to fix this I added <code>git push origin :gh-pages</code> to my command. So now my &quot;deploy&quot; command in my package.json looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;git push origin :gh-pages &amp;&amp; git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages&quot;,
    ...
  },
</code></pre>
<p>This works great. I simply type <code>npm run deploy</code> in my terminal and <code>git push origin :gh-pages</code> deletes the existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch and <code>git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages</code> creates a new <code>gh-pages</code> branch with my changes. Excellent!</p>
<p>But ... the final problem I can't seem to figure out is this. If it's the first time running the deploy command, the gh-pages branch won't exist and my deploy script fails.</p>
<p>So is there a way to conditionally run the <code>git push origin :gh-pages</code> part? Something like <code>if origin gh-pages exists ... git push origin :gh-pages</code>?</p>
<p>By the way, deleting a branch this way (using a leading colon) was totally new to me. And the <a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#git-push-codegitpushoriginexperimentalcode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">git-push man page</a> didn't explain it well. To understand how <code>git push origin :gh-pages</code> results in deleting the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, take a look at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45657462/why-does-this-command-delete-a-remote-branch-git-push-origin-branchname"">this link</a>.</p>

<p>I recently successfully deployed a React website to GitHub pages, following the often recommended steps of installing gh-pages to the project, adding a homepage property to the package.json file, adding scripts to the scripts properties on the package.json file, running 'npm run deploy' and so on. It worked fine, and now a build of the project has been added to my repository (<a href=""https://github.com/StephenDoyle10/stephendoyle10.github.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), and I can view the actual project online (<a href=""https://stephendoyle10.github.io/#/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>
<p>However, the issue I have is this: most guides on deploying a react app also mention the following steps:
in the terminal type:</p>
<p>git add .</p>
<p>git commit -m &quot;commit&quot;</p>
<p>git push origin master</p>
<p>These final steps are often listed as optional. Everything worked fine without me doing these steps: my code was added to the repository, and my website is deployed online, so <strong>what do these steps do exactly? Why are they considered optional? What is best practice?</strong></p>

That domain isn't a registered domain in our github organization settings. I really have no clue where it got the name from, it seems completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get a <code>ORGANIZATION_NAME.github.io</code> or similar default domain?</p>

<p>And my translation files are put to <code>public/locales/de/translation.json</code> (and other than <code>de</code> folders), the same as in docs.</p>

<p>It works in dev mode. I deployed the app to heroku, it also works just fine there. But I need it to work in github pages site and my jsons (translation.json files) are not loaded there and I get these errors (from browser console):</p>

<p><code>Failed to load http://hereIsMyUsername.github.io/locales/en/translation.json resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()</code></p>

<p>After building react app I have the following structure of my <code>build</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>build
- locales
- static
  - css
  - js
  - media
</code></pre>

<p>So generally my app works fine in github pages except it can't load jsons. I read in docs that it because github pages tries to load these jsons from root directory and can't find them there, because they are stored in locales/{lang}/translation.json. So recommended way is to put all json and other files to root. But as I have lots of different translation.json files it's not the way to manage it.</p>

<p>So my question is how to make github pages work with it? Or how to configure my i18n to work for github pages?</p>

<p>not even mentioning work arounds i have to use for ssh-wagon and Java8 javadoc and others</p>

<p>The plugins used are IMHO a ""moving target"". Something that worked a few months ago in my experience will not work today. So I keep fixing my pom.xml files to keep up and the files grow longer and longer. </p>

<p>For my internal projects I use a parent pom to make sure that the projects have a common configuration. For the open source projects I did not find a way to use a parent pom for a group of projects yet. </p>

<p>I would like to make sure that a working configuration that i found is ""transferred"" to other configurations. I am thinking e.g. of </p>

<ol>
<li>a script that might check the configuration</li>
<li>some kind of inheritance mechanism like the parent pom</li>
</ol>

<p>I assume this is a pretty common problem and there are experiences by SO users on how to tackle this issue accross different project.</p>

<li>parent pom with pom packaging

<p>Even more strangely, the local server I run with <code>jekyll serve</code> <em>does</em> show the right date, and use the right permalink.</p>

<p>However I met some issues when creating <code>ng2-raw</code>. After debugging, it could not find <code>css</code> or <code>html</code> by relative path (which are under same path as <code>ts</code>), so I modified path to make it work.</p>

<p>Please check out the different code in my two repo:</p>

<p>github.com/MoYummy/ng2-lite/blob/master/src/app/hello.component.ts</p>

This is NOT a duplicate question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39051959/angular2-base-url-and-relative-paths-on-gh-pages"">This question</a> explains the problem but that project was not built with angular-cli, as mine is, hence I do not have a <code>webpack.config</code> file.</p>

<p>Whilst the issue I describe below is clearly about getting the base_url setting correct, it is not the same as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34516651/set-base-url-for-angular-2-http-requests"">this issue</a>, which is about setting up angular to send requests to a base_url like an api.</p>

<hr>

<p>My project builds and runs on localhost and also on <code>github:pages</code> (even the css all loads correctly). The only thing which does not work on github:pages are the images, which all return 404s (even though I can see them if I navigate to the assets folder directly in the browser).</p>

<p>The problem is that on localhost, angular-cli runs the project with no subfolder after the hostname. But on <code>github:pages</code> it does.</p>

<p>Say for example the project name is <code>testapp</code> then on <code>github:pages</code> it is deployed here:</p>

<pre><code>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/testapp
</code></pre>

<p>The images are in</p>

<pre><code>src/assets/images
</code></pre>

<p>They are referenced in css inside angular-2 component using relative paths like this:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url('../../assets/images/dining-room.png');
</code></pre>

<p>So how do I configure angular-2 production deployment file so that in production the path becomes:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url('testapp/assets/dining-room.png');
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that <code>github:pages</code> is based off Jekyll and I understand <a href=""https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this explanation</a>, but what I don't understand is how do you configure an angular-cli project to be aware that <code>github:pages</code> is using a folder to deploy the app.</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p>

<p>So far I have figured out that the command line for deploying to <code>github:pages</code> has a base_href option. So I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>ng github-pages:deploy --base-href /testapp/
</code></pre>

<p>I can then see in the /dist folder that the html file has been changed to include the base href, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;base href=""/testapp/""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would have expected this to fix the problem automatically, but the images still return a 404. This base_href is not being automatically injected into the relative paths, as you would expect. Locally the index.html file has <code>&lt;base href=""/""&gt;</code> and obviously that works.</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>In trying to solve this I am coming to believe this is related to the way Angular builds components. A very good explanation of that can be found <a href=""http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/06/08/component-relative-paths-in-angular-2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

After working on a repository in my computer i've opened the terminal to commit the changes to the github account with the purpose of updating the gh-pages branch (after 4 days of work).<br>
I did not notice that I was on gh-pages branch already when a did the <code>git status</code> so I did as if I where on branch master.That is what I did:<br>
1. <code>git add -A</code><br>
2. <code>git commit -m ""message""</code><br>
3. <code>git push origin master</code><br>
After this I noticed that I was doing this in the gh-pages branch so I thought (not very cleverly) that i should go back to branch master to do the commits also there and then i did <code>git checkout master</code>. In that moment all my files (my local files, in my computer) went back in time!<br>
The terminal showed a commit number when I did the first commit [gh-pages 4108d5a] but i can not find it in the github history.<br>
Is there a way to recovery the previous state in my local files?? Thanks.</p>

<p>I have tried adding a base name to the history in my connectedRouter (using react-router-redux), still the same error.</p>

<p>I updated the repository address to include my username and password credentials to rule out any logging in issues.</p>

<p>I renamed my repository back to its original name thinking possible this was the problem.</p>

<p>I also renamed the build folder created to docs and tried to run github pages that way, via the master/docs option on github (since there seems to be no option to manually choose the gh-pages branch like a lot of instructions say there is). I still did not have any luck. I do think that this is the way I will have to do it though as I have just realised when i do try and host the master/docs on github pages it does in fact show my react-app title on the browser tab but it does not load anything.</p>

I had the same problem when I was serving the page locally, but then followed along to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36141859/refreshing-page-gives-cannot-get-page-url-in-react-router-2"">this SO answer</a> and made a server.js file which provided a redirect to my static HTML page at each route. Here is what the file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>""use strict"";
let express = require('express');
let path = require('path');


let app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/contact', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile('public/index.html', { root: __dirname });
})

app.get('/about', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile('public/index.html', { root: __dirname });
})

app.get('*', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile('public/index.html', { root: __dirname });
})

app.listen(8080, function(){
  console.log('Listening on port 8080!')
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my problem is that when I push the project to github pages all of that logic is ignored, github's routing takes over and I have the same problem of not being able to refresh or go straight to <code>/contact</code> or <code>/about</code>. I know it seems like an obvious problem to run into, since github pages is designed to only host static sites, but I've seen people hinting towards other ways of creating a static page for each route, such as the answer in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/39tlb0/has_anyone_done_reactrouter_using_historylocation/cs6cbrn/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this reddit post</a>, but I have no idea how to do that. </p>

<p>I should also mention that because I already have a site at <code>user-name.github.io</code>, so this site is being hosted at <code>user-name.github.io/projects</code>, making that my <code>/</code> route. I have no idea if this makes any difference, I just thought I should mention it.</p>

<p>I think I've pretty much exhausted every option to try and successfully host this on gh-pages and I know there are projects like <a href=""https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages</a> to try and fix this issue but, I just wanted to see if anyone out there has had any luck doing this before resorting to that.</p>

<p>FYI, here is my <strong>app.js</strong> (containing routing logic):</p>

<pre><code>import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import {Router, Route, browserHistory, IndexRoute} from 'react-router';
//Import custom components
import About from '../components/about.js';
import Contact from '../components/contact.js';
import Sidebar from '../components/sidebar.js';
import Imagelist from '../components/image-list.js';


  render(
      &lt;Router history={browserHistory}&gt;
        &lt;Route path=""/"" component={Sidebar}&gt;
          &lt;IndexRoute component={Imagelist}/&gt;
          &lt;Route path=""/about"" component={About}/&gt;
          &lt;Route path=""/contact"" component={Contact}/&gt;
        &lt;/Route&gt;
      &lt;/Router&gt;,
      document.getElementById('content')
    );

1- Created a repository called ""username.github.io"" on my github root;<br/>
2- ng new portfolio --dir=.  (So the project will be created on the ""username.github.io folder"");<br/>
3- Changing ""angular.json"" file so the outputPath is ""dist/"" only, removing the work portfolio from it;<br/>
4- ng build --base-href=<a href=""https://username.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://username.github.io/</a>;<br/>
5- ngh;<br/>
6- Commit and push changes to master;<br/></p>

<p>No error messages show up, but then when i try to reach the url ""username.github.io"" it shows up error 404.</p>

<p>I've tried a bunch of different configurations and each time a different thing happens. On github my repo is configurated to use the master branch (this is the default configuration and can't be changed for user pages).</p>

I put up a regular html static website in there and it works great. (I also set a custom domain with a CNAME file and CNAME DNS record so that myuser.github.io goes to www.example.com)</p>

<p>Then I also made a <code>/blog</code> folder in that repo and I put in a jekyll blog template.</p>

<p>Running <code>jekyll build serve</code> or <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> locally gives me no errors. I can make new posts and they show up on <code>localhost:4000/blog/</code>.</p>

<li>If I try to access <code>www.example.com/blog/index.html</code> I get a 404. </li>
<li>If I try, with the /blog/ and the error still in the repo, to make any new changes to my repo (e.g. change the title of my main,
non-blog page, or change a random image etc) and I push, the changes
do not register online at all (though they show on github.com in the
repo file tree).</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that github freaks out due to that error and won't update until it's fixed.</p>

<p>How can I figure out what that ""main.scss"" error is? Since it's fine locally.
I am new to jekyll (and github pages) but I followed the documentation as best I could.</p>

<p>I have also created a github pages based on a project (sveltekit) so the url is myuser.github.io/sveltekit. The repo is set so that github pages is served from gh-pages and root. This only sorts of works(!)</p>
<p>The problem is navigation. Here is the navigation code in __layout.svelte</p>
<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/settings&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/a&gt;

<p>But when I run this under github Pages, the home page comes up but the other links show as myuser/github.io/about which will give a 404.</p>
<p>if the code is</p>
<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;./about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;./settings&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>then other links work once and are then eg myuser.github.io/about/settings which is, once again, a 404.</p>
<p>So though github pages allows me to have sub repos under the top level, navigation for these is based on root of the top level rather than root being defined as the root of that repo. And the only options are root and /docs.</p>
<p>Is there a way of setting root to /sveltekit/ ?</p>
<p>Another problem is that styling is displaying on github pages though does when the site is run under preview or dev.</p>

<p>Been following this otherwise <a href=""https://tddapps.com/2015/09/02/Start-a-Blog-in-20-minutes/"" rel=""nofollow"">good workflow description</a> by analogy.</p>

<p><strong>Only hint at a problem I could find is from <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, where it states 'For User Pages, use the master branch in your username.github.io repository. For Project Pages, use the gh-pages branch in your project's repository'.</strong></p>

<p>So I seem to have defined a user page, but there is 1) no 'master' branch and 2) currently no project defined. My understanding is a user page should be show independently of whatever else exists. Rather confusing.</p>

<p>History? In the browser:</p>

<ol>
<li>forked the well-known <a href=""https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive"" rel=""nofollow"">feeling-responsive</a> Jekyll theme</li>
<li>renamed the resulting repository to <a href=""https://github.com/cantillate/cantillate.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">cantillate.github.io</a></li>
</ol>

<p>In a terminal window:</p>

<ol>
<li>cd'd into my desktop (mac os x)</li>
<li>did a 'git clone <a href=""https://github.com/cantillate/.cantillate.github.io.git"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cantillate/.cantillate.github.io.git</a>'</li>
<li>did a 'cd cantillate.github.io'</li>

<li>did local edits, restarting Jekyll and going to <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:4000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</a> each time. In a browser, local blog is displayed fine .</li>
<li>did a 'git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""publishing"" &amp;&amp; git push', signing into my github account.</li>
</ol>

<p>---> All successful, with changes perfectly visible in the github repo in a browser, yet hours later the blog itself is still not shown at <a href=""http://cantillate.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cantillate.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>As a newcomer, part of the problem is the scarcity of existing repository reuse workflow descriptions, especially those cleanly describing each of user / project / organisation variants.</p>

<p>I first thought Disqus is doing something stupid, but I found <a href=""https://www.hashtagsecurity.com/csp-disqus-are-buddies/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> which makes me think I'm doing something wrong, like using jquery to load Disqus. But I don't see what is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Another thought I had is, that maybe my cookie banner or privace badger is causing problems, but Privacy Badger is configured to only block google analytics on the site and even allowing that, doesn't make it work. </p>

<p>Also everything works as intended when running <code>jekyll serve</code> locally. </p>

<p>And I excluded the cookie banner as the source of the problem, by removing it temporarly, without any effect on Disqus</p>

<p>I don't think <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34520908/disquss-on-an-amp-page-inside-an-amp-iframe"">this SO question</a> is the same problem, because I don't have an iframe.</p>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://processingjs.org/articles/jsQuickStart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">guide</a>, the pde code should be compiled into pure javascript.  I can understand why git would not allow me to commit a file type it doesn't recognize, but is there a way to compile the pde into js and simply commit the outputted file?  Has anyone done this or something similar to get processingjs to work on github pages?</p>

<p>I do have the images saved in the same document as my index.html and style.css but in it's own folder. And the images are either png or jpeg.</p>
<p>I noticed some people say the caplocks do make a difference so I edited png and jpeg on github as PNG and JPEG. Still didn't make a difference.</p>

<p>I don't have background on c. I am not sure what the issue is and how to fix it. </p>

<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>I've tried different Ruby versions(2.1.7/2.2.3) and x86/x64, all resulted the same error. I also tried in another machine with win7 ultimate and installation without any error. I am suspecting there is some error specific to this particular win7 ent machine.</p>

So, I need to host the react.js project in a GitHub domain. So I did some research and deployed the react.js in the GitHub domain. And I deployed the project successfully by doing these steps :</p>
<p>1.I created a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>2.Then I used this code in Terminal: <code>npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code></p>
<p>3.Then I add this line in the package.json file:
<code>&quot;homepage&quot;:&quot;http://&lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;&quot;</code> and I added this also in the package.json, scripts:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;scripts&quot;: {
&quot;predeploy&quot;: &quot;npm run build&quot;,
&quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;gh-pages -d build&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>after that i added this also in package.json:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;devDependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;gh-pages&quot;: &quot;^3.1.0&quot;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>4.Then I added remote and committed the code and pushed the code like this:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;github-username&gt;/&lt;repository-name&gt;.git
git add .
git commit -m &quot;initial commit&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>5.Then I used this code to deploy the app:<code>npm run deploy</code></p>
<p>After That Everything was successful and my site hosted as <code>https://&lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;</code></p>
<p>Then I tried to modify this site, but I can't. When I go to Settings&gt;Pages I found that the deployed branch is <code>gh-pages</code> and this branch wasn't created by me. I changed it back to master and saved it. And when I refreshed the site, there was nothing except the readme.md file. So, I changed it back to <code>gh-pages</code> and it worked again. Then I did some research to modify and I found that I just need to commit and use this code again:<code>npm run deploy</code></p>
<p>So, I did like That and This Was shown in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sample@0.1.0 predeploy
&gt; npm run build


&gt; sample@0.1.0 build
&gt; react-scripts build

'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>What's this all about? I need a solution to modify a deployed react.js app.
Anyone Who answers my problem will be appreciated.
Thank you 🙏.</p>

<p>The <code>/path/to/file.pdf</code>, when shared from Google Drive (made publicly available), works. But, it does not work when I try to show the files kept within the <code>docs</code> folder in my github repository.</p>

<p>For github pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>only the contents of the <code>docs</code> folder are pushed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch and then GitHub Pages publishes these contents as the website.</li>

<p>To achieve this I have to create a website, host it and then create a Facebook app in order to render the website inside it.</p>

Now I am having so many pages and I would like to manage them in a folder called <code>_pages</code>. I ideally want to have this structure:</p>

<pre><code>root

      |-&gt; Index.md
      |-&gt; contact.md
      |-&gt; cv

          |-&gt; my_cv.pdf
  |-&gt; _posts
  |-&gt; [other things such as config and gemfile]

<p>This I have done defining default permalinks in the <code>_config.yml</code> adding:</p>

<pre><code>include:
  - _pages

defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""_pages""
      type: ""pages""
    values:
      permalink: /:basename/ # make URL of pages in the folder _pages as on the root.
</code></pre>

<p>That works perfectly.</p>

<p>However, as you see inside the <code>_pages</code> I would like to have another subfolder named <code>cv</code> and put my <code>cv.md</code> and <code>my_cv.pdf</code> in the same folder (in the actual website I have much more of these files for pages.). <strong>Ultimately I would like to have a benefit of using <code>[Download my CV](my_cv.pdf)</code> relative local linking</strong>, which I suppose because the pdf and the .md file are in the same folder it will recognize it. However it is not the case. <code>cv.md</code> has the permalink of /cv/ and not the <strong>cv</strong> folder. So when I use <code>[Download my CV](my_cv.pdf)</code> it creates <code>root/cv/my_cv.pdf</code> where this pdf file actually does not exist!</p>

<p>How can I manage to fix this thing? what is your trick?</p>

<p>The <code>README.md</code> gets automatically converted to <code>index.html</code>, which is very helpful for quickly getting started.  </p>

<p>However, I would like to have a separately-written main page <code>index.md</code>, and instead convert <code>README.md</code> to <code>README.html</code> (as it does with most <code>*.md</code> files).  When I add my <code>index.md</code>, Jekyll converts it to <code>index.html</code> as hoped, but now gives no conversion at all of <code>README.md</code> — presumably it has <code>index.html</code> as the target for both <code>README.md</code> and <code>index.md</code>, and the latter wins.</p>

<p><strong>How do I tell Jekyll to go back to using <code>README.html</code> as its conversion target for <code>README.md</code>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Preferably, I would like a solution that doesn’t require adding config data in <code>README.md</code> itself</strong>, so that I can continue to keep <code>README.md</code> in sync with the human-readable version in the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>Note for reproducing it: all this occurs both when built online through Github Pages, and with a local <code>jekyll build</code>.  The only custom jekyll settings I am using are <code>gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins</code> in the site’s <code>Gemfile</code>, and <code>theme: jekyll-theme-dinky</code> in the site’s <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>It seems to be specific to the Github Pages themes, but not to the Dinky theme: other themes beside Dinky exhibit the same behaviour, but a bare Jekyll site does not seem to.</p>

<p>Edit: thanks to @wasthishelpful for a very helpful comment and partial answer.  Adding a YAML frontmatter block to <code>README.md</code> setting <code>permalink: README.html</code> does what I was looking for.  Unfortunately I’m still not finding a way to achieve the same effect just by modifying <code>_config.yml</code>: e.g. adding a frontmatter default there</p>

<pre><code>defaults:
  - 
    scope:
      path: ""README.md""
    values:
      permalink: ""README.html""
</code></pre>

<p>doesn’t seem to have any effect.  (I’ve tried both with and without the quote marks around the filenames, and both before and after the line <code>theme: jekyll-theme-dinky</code>.)</p>

<p>Searching google, I am able to find a few resources that mention this error, however I am not able to work around this. Is this a problem with the gem, the documentation, or my configuration? </p>

<li>I've installed the bookdown package in R and have opened up the sample book in R.  How do I get this sample book onto Github website?  I just uploaded all the files and when I go to my website, it just takes me to README.md</li>
<li>I am using Github through my browser and don't plan on installing whatever Github software there is and all that kind of stuff.  I really don't have time to dig into how to use Github.  So any tutorial will require me using Github through the browser.</li>

<p>There are plenty of books out there on Github (bookdown.org show cases many).  I believe you are able to view the files/code and what not on Github, so it may be pretty easy to just grab a couple necessary files there.  I don't know which ones are important, and even if I did, I don't know how to get it to work with my Github.</p>

In the <code>master</code> branch of this project is a directory <code>html</code> containing the files for the project page. So, e.g. the project <code>https://github.com/con-f-use/foobar</code> has a file <code>./html/index.html</code> that is reachable over <code>https://con-f-use.github.io/foobar/index.html</code>. </p>

<p>So far, when I change the html in the <code>master</code> branch, usually I update the project page (which git requires to be in its own branch <code>gh-pages</code>) via the command:</p>

<pre><code> git subtree push --prefix html origin gh-pages   # From master branch
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to configure git, to do that updating automatically, every time when I push something to <code>master</code>. Optionally it would be nice, but ultimately unimportant, if it worked the other way around, too. So I can push to <code>gh-pages</code> and master gets the changes in <code>./html</code> without me manually fiddling around. I'm aware that git allows one to specify post-commit scripts. I could just put the above command in one of those scripts. The problem with that is, I'd have to manually specify this script for every local clone of the repository. I'd rather have github do it non-locally.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to configure github to keep the the <code>./html/</code> directory from the <code>master</code> branch automatically up to date with the root <code>./</code> of the <code>gh-pages</code> branch (and vice verso) and do it without me changing local git configuration?</strong></p>

<p>So what I want, is, that whenever I push to <code>gh-pages</code>, the <code>./html</code>in the <code>master</code> branch gets the changes as well. Likewise, when I push new changes in the <code>./html</code> directory of <code>master</code>, these changes should automatically propagate to <code>gh-pages</code> root <code>./</code> directory.</p>

<p>I need to embed html comments that are visible when viewing the source of a page. The reason for this that I want to be able to <strong>visually use comments to differentiate</strong> between the different parts of raw source html markup. This is doable by using regular html syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- here's my comment --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I've encountered is that while I serve my jekyll site locally I do see comments in the page source, but once pushed to my github repository the comment <em>isn't</em> visible anymore. However it's still visible in my repo when viewing the raw markdown source file.</p>

<p>The behavior I expect would be seeing my comment in the page source code like I do locally. I've tried <a href=""https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kramdown comment syntax</a>:</p>

<pre><code>{::comment}
 here's my comment
{:/comment}
</code></pre>

<p>This works but this way I don't see it in the page source at all. Another solution I've tried is the workaround described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/comments-in-markdown/20885980#20885980"">this response</a>. It works but it produces an actual html tag and therefore any <strong>clear separation</strong> between the comment and the other html tags is lost.</p>

<p>The bottom-line is that <em>I want to see the comment when viewing my page source</em> even <em>after pushing</em> my files to my repository.</p>

<p>Is there something I'm missing here or isn't it possible to keep html comments intact while used in conjunction with github-pages?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Turns out it was not a markup or Github problem after all. I use a CDN service, this minified the HTML and stripped away HTML comments.</em></p>

<p>The article on my blog about brownian motion (see <a href=""http://magnusmetz.github.io/2012/11/brownian-motion-with-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magnusmetz.github.io/2012/11/brownian-motion-with-r/</a>) is based on exactly the same *.Rmd file as the one on vistat (see <a href=""http://vis.supstat.com/2012/11/brownian-motion-with-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis.supstat.com/2012/11/brownian-motion-with-r/</a>). In the version on my blog you will realize the animated graphic in the article is missing. Also the LaTeX expressions are shown incorrectly. If you compare the two source files on Github (see <a href=""https://github.com/magnusmetz/magnusmetz.github.io/blob/master/_source/2012-11-06-brownian-motion-with-r.Rmd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/magnusmetz/magnusmetz.github.io/blob/master/_source/2012-11-06-brownian-motion-with-r.Rmd</a> for my blog and <a href=""https://github.com/supstat/vistat/blob/gh-pages/_source/2012-11-06-brownian-motion-with-r.Rmd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/supstat/vistat/blob/gh-pages/_source/2012-11-06-brownian-motion-with-r.Rmd</a> for vistat) you will see that they are exactly the same. In both blogs the *.Rmd files have to be compiled using the script you can find in <code>_bin/knit</code> of each of the two blogs. The result is a markdown files, which is stored in <code>_posts/</code> by the execution of the script with </p>

<p><code>./_bin/knit yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-the-script.Rmd</code> through the terminal.</p>

<p>My question now is, why are the animations not shown at all in my blog and why are the LaTeX expressions shown incorrectly? </p>

<p>I already filed an issue to vistat (see <a href=""https://github.com/supstat/vistat/issues/13"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/supstat/vistat/issues/13</a>) but with no results so far.</p>

<p>It really would be great, if somebody could help me to answer this question. Please don't hesitate to ask, if you need further information.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance for your answers.</p>

I tested it out using a 'jekyll now' theme and they both connected! However, the file structure seems a bit different to regular jekyll (it doesn't even have _posts folder- meaning, I have to write my content in the index.html). So now, I'm trying to get it up using regular jekyll (this theme to be specific: <a href=""http://thephuse.github.io/strange_case/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://thephuse.github.io/strange_case/</a>). I downloaded the repo on my machine and yes it does work locally. But when I upload those files from my desktop into a new github repo (named: .github.io) and access the site using https://.github.io, the front page displays but without the formatting or images etc. It also isn't able to open any of the links to the posts- simply displays a 404. I think this means that github is rendering it as a regular html file and not able to make out that this a jekyll theme or maybe something along those lines- but I'm not able to figure out what the issue is and how to resolve it - so I can have the theme up and running as well as connected to my custom domain (which I manage on godaddy btw).</p>

I noticed quickly that most of the css background images failed to load.
After doing some digging around I found that the culprit is my SCSS/CSS.</p>

<p>In VSCode, my relative path for an image looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  @media (min-resolution: 192dpi) and (min-width: 37.5em),
    (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (min-width: 37.5em),
    (min-width: 125em) {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
        to right bottom,
        rgba($color-primary-light, 0.801),
        rgba($color-primary-dark, 0.801)
      ),
      url(../../img/apple-mountains_1920.jpg);
</code></pre>

<p>However, this was causing the URL to become clipped, stepping backward out of the repository.</p>

<p>What it should be:</p>

<p><code>https://name.gethub.io/repositoryname/img/apple-mountains_1920.jpg</code></p>

<p>What I was getting:</p>

<p><code>https://name.gethub.io/img/apple-mountains_1920.jpg</code></p>

<p>To fix this, I simply needed to go through and remove one period from all of my background-image paths:</p>

<p><code>url(../../img/apple-mountains_1920.jpg);</code></p>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<p><code>url(./../img/apple-mountains_1920.jpg);</code></p>

<p>One thing that is interesting, is that in VSCode on my machine, if I don't use the format (../../img...) the file isn't found.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? I'm fairly new to deployment, is this going to be a problem with any webhost I use or is it something unique to Github pages?</p>

<p>Better yet, is there a way I can automate fix this in my build process?
Right now I just run my SCSS through this series:</p>

<p><code>""compile:sass"": ""node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.comp.css"",
""concat:css"": ""concat -o css/style.concat.css css/icon-font.css css/style.comp.css"",
""prefix:css"": ""postcss --use autoprefixer -b \""last 5 versions\"" css/style.concat.css -o css/style.prefix.css"",
""compress:css"": ""node-sass css/style.prefix.css css/main.css --output-style compressed"",
</code></p>

<p>EDIT: 
My File tree structure is:</p>

<pre><code>Project Folder
|- index.html
|- [css folder]
|- [img folder]
|- [js folder]
|- [sass folder]

I followed the <a href=""https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jekyll-now</a> guide and got everything running fairly quickly. </p>

<p>I did some work in my local repo and added a menu item (called ""presentations"") at the top of the page. When I use <code>jekyll serve</code> and view the site locally, everything works as expected. However, after pushing the changes to my remote repository, clicking the ""presentations"" link results in a 404. </p>

<p>I thought this may be due to the fact that <code>_site</code> is in <code>.gitignore</code>, but after adding <code>_site</code> to my remote repository, it still did not work. I'm confused as to why this is happening since the ""about"" link works fine when viewing the site both locally and on the web, but my ""presentations"" link only works locally. I'm guessing that this has to do with the way GitHub pages is ingesting things behind the scenes?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I kind of figured out the problem. I have a git repo called ""presentations"" (with a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>). When I clicked the ""presentations"" link at the top of the page, I'm guessing it was directed to this repository, and I'm guessing I got the 404 because it didn't find an <code>index.html</code> file here. I changed the link name and location from ""presentations"" to ""slides"" and everything works. Except I want to use the name ""presentations"" instead of slides. I need to figure out a way to get an index file in the <code>presentations</code> repo, but I'm not sure about the best approach (e.g. put my presentations in my <code>username.github.io</code> repo and VC them in there, symlink an index file from <code>username.github.io</code> repo to my <code>presentations</code> repo (this just sounds bad), or something else?). </p>

I did so by creating a CNAME folder in the Pages repository and adding this CNAME as well as a few A variables to the DNS records with my domain provider (Domain.com) An hour or so after making these DNS changes, Github pages said my site was published on the new domain.</p>
<p>I shared the link to my new website with a few people. Several of them were able to access it without any issue; however, some reported that they received an empty white page when arriving to the site or a generic page with messaging along the lines of 'this domain hasn't been set up.' The failure to see the site seems to have no pattern across browser or device.</p>
<p>For me personally, I was able to see the site last night but this morning after deploying some new changes, I couldn't see the site for 30 minutes or so, until it suddenly worked again. During the time I couldn't see it, other friends reported that they were able to view it.</p>
<p>Any idea why this might be happening? I'm brand new to this stuff and I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>From what I could tell, this can sometimes happen if you use <code>jekyll serve</code> as opposed to <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> and if there is a mismatch between your version of jekyll and the one required by github pages, but here I do use <code>bundle exec</code> and so the correct version of jekyll is used.</p>

<p>jekyll itself works if i try to create a new site with <code>jekyll new blah</code> and i can serve that one locally without a problem, but the combo of jekyll and github pages is giving me grief.</p>

<p>Now the ""app"" itself is separated from the users content, the user content is version controlled but the app is not (or at least doesn't need to be for the functionality of the app itself), but both need to be uploaded to github pages and to isolate the content's version control, and to have different permissions for the app vs content, I host the app itself in gh-pages and the content as a git <strong>submodule</strong> inside the gh-pages repo.</p>

<p>This works, the app/site is built and gets exposed on <code>username.github.io/sitename/</code> with everything accessible, except there is a catch.</p>

<p>The catch is that for some reason <strong>the submodule content repo is referred to at a specific commit</strong> instead of just the latest version of the repo, which means I can't just update the content repo and have everything work but also have to update the app repo to refer to the latest version of the submodule, on <em>every content repo commit</em>.</p>

<p>Which gets a bit tedious since I almost never actually have to update the app repo unless there is a new version of the app but I update the content repo daily, as well as the fact that the content repo should be editable by many people but the app repo by few.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I define a submodule to always refer to the latest commit of a repo?</li>
<li>How can I trigger a build of the site by only updating the submodule repo?</li>
<li>How can the gh-pages repo always reflect the latest version of its submodules, so that the gh-pages site is always serving the latest content?</li>

And now I want to create a different Github page, a resume, in another repository using a different theme to my blog so I can't add the resume as a part of my blog.</p>

<p>So, after googling, I knew that I can create several Github page in different repository from the answer of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15563685/can-i-create-more-than-one-repository-for-github-pages"">this similar question</a></p>

<p>Then I try to use the method mentioned in the answer based on my understanding.
So I,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Directly push the Resume repository to ""gh-pages""
using <code>git push origin gh-pages</code>
And I failed, of course, with the error info below,</p>

<pre><code>error: src refspec gh-pages does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/SeasonLeee/Resume-Chinese                                                                                                                .git'
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>which let me know that it might because the Resume repository have no branch so that it failed. </p>

<p>2.Then I go to the blog repository to create a branch named ""gh-pages"", well, this time I don't know how to push a repository, the Resume, to another repository's branch(the blog page's branch, ""gh-pages"")</p>

<p>Please, help me! I don't know what's wrong! The question I found seems so easy to operate as they simply said: ""push the repository to 'gh-pages'"". But where exactly is this ""gh-pages""? They said it's a branch, then whose branch? If it's the existing Github page's branch, how to add a whole repository to another branch???</p>

<p>I tried the following command, but none of them worked!</p>

<p><code>git push blog-github-page-repository-name gh-pages</code></p>

<p><code>git push https://github.com/SeasonLeee/SeasonLeee.github.io.git gh-pages</code></p>

<p>Help!!!! I really don't what they said ""push the repository to gh-pages branch"" means...T^T</p>

<p>If you have some much more simple method, strongly welcome you share to me, thank you in advance! </p>

<p>The Resume cost me like 3 days to build and I want to use it instead of using Microsoft word to make one, I really want to use my programming knowledge even though I know I so suck at present. So thank you whoever happens to see this question and share me your solution, thank you!</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/commits/gh-pages/css/desktop.css"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is the <code>gh-pages</code> branch version history of a generated css file, <code>desktop.css</code>. It seems that every time the scss files are changed and committed, the <code>desktop.css</code> file is also regenerated <em>and</em> committed. That seems unnecessary to store.</p>

<p>I am thinking of the parallel in projects that use css preprocessors like Sass or Javascript bundlers.  We typically don't version the generated code since it just repeats data we already have (the precompiled/prebundled code). If we wanted to go back to an earlier version, we would restore an older version of the Sass, for example, and regenerate the css from there. The same should be said for regenerating an earlier version of a gh-pages page, no? Also there's the issue of unnecessary artifacts and bloat to the repository from these generated files. </p>

<p>Is there a workaround that can have the building of the code happen <em>without</em> versioning generated css/js? One possibility I thought was about purging and re-branching the <code>gh-pages</code> branch each time I need to regenerate but that seems extreme. I sometimes wonder if Github should offer <code>gh-pages</code> as a <em>tag</em> as well as a branch so that we can move that tag to point to a different commit whenever we need Travis CI or what have you to regenerate.  </p>

<p>How are others addressing this? Or is it just not a big deal?</p>

<p><strong>Update Thu Dec 18 19:28:16 EST 2014</strong></p>

<p>David gave a nice answer below that is Jekyll specific, demonstrating a <a href=""https://github.com/djacquel/JekyllDoc"" rel=""nofollow"">jekyll site with just scss</a> but whose <a href=""http://jekyll.pygmeeweb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">hosted github page</a> was built with generated css.  It seems the magic is in the _config.yml file. While I like the answer (and upvoted it), it does not address the general case.  </p>

<p>For now I think I will go with a periodic git purge approach. I will deploy to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, letting it version the generated css/js. Then every once in a while, if i feel the repo has gotten too bloated, I will just empty the branch with <code>git filter-branch</code> commands as <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">explained by Github</a> or just delete it locally and remotely and recreate it. That way, I get the flexibility of using whatever static site generator I want, adjusting and generating as much as I need, and keeping repo size manageable. At the price of an extra few steps.</p>

I have followed this tutorial on how to set up service workers: </p>

<p>Having uploaded the contents of the <code>dist</code> folder (the same as I do on my development server) the service worker fails to register due to getting 404's on the contents of the <code>assets</code>folder. It looks for files in <code>/assets/...</code>.</p>

<p>My best guess is that it works on my dev server because the application is hosted in the web server ROOT, but in the case of the Github page it gets hosted in the .../AngTodo directory. </p>

<p>So my question is as follows: how to I specify for sw-precache to output this SW with an appended prefix (<code>/AngTodo/assets/...</code> in my case)?</p>

<p>My <code>sw-precache-config.js</code> is as follows:</p>

I create a ""project site"" github page, as explained in <a href=""https://pages.github.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pages.github.com</a>, and select the theme 'jekyll-theme-cayman'.</p>

<p>However, when I edit the index.md file in github editor, the preview looks different from the output in my github page (produced by jekyll). I have only two files: <code>_config.yml</code> with the content:</p>

<pre><code>theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>index.md</code> with the content:</p>

<pre><code># test
this url is not automatically auto-linked: http://example.com
</code></pre>

<p>I installed jekyll in my computer, but it fails as follows when trying to generate the output for my project site:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
Configuration file: /private/tmp/test/_config.yml
jekyll 3.6.2 | Error:  The jekyll-theme-cayman theme could not be found.
</code></pre>

<p>How can I solve this?</p>

<p>Also, the text <code>http://example.com</code> is auto-linked by default in the github editor, but not in the jekyll output. I read <a href=""https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this documentation</a>, and I tried with this <code>_config.yml</code> but it does not work:</p>

<pre><code>theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  autolink: true
</code></pre>

<p>How can I auto-link?</p>

<p>also, the 'jekyll-theme-cayman' theme has a very tall header. how can I configure the theme? does this theme allow to change the header? where can I find the code of the theme and make changes?</p>

<p>this loads perfectly. However, when I upload the same template to github pages website, the css and js does not load from jquery <a href=""https://giveedu.github.io/vocab/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see here</a></p>

<p>Here is the html of website</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
    &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""&gt;

    &lt;script src=""http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.2/jquery.mobile-1.1.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt; 


&lt;body&gt; 

&lt;!-- Start of first page: #one --&gt;
&lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""one""&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""header""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Multi-page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /header --&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""content"" &gt;  
        &lt;h2&gt;One&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I have an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of ""one"" on my page container. I'm first in the source order so I'm shown when the page loads.&lt;/p&gt; 

        &lt;p&gt;This is a multi-page boilerplate template that you can copy to build your first jQuery Mobile page. This template contains multiple ""page"" containers inside, unlike a &lt;a href=""page-template.html""&gt; single page template&lt;/a&gt; that has just one page within it.&lt;/p&gt;  
        &lt;p&gt;Just view the source and copy the code to get started. All the CSS and JS is linked to the jQuery CDN versions so this is super easy to set up. Remember to include a meta viewport tag in the head to set the zoom level.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You link to internal pages by referring to the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the page you want to show. For example, to &lt;a href=""#two"" &gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the page with an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of ""two"", my link would have a &lt;code&gt;href=""#two""&lt;/code&gt; in the code.&lt;/p&gt;   

        &lt;h3&gt;Show internal pages:&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#two"" data-role=""button""&gt;Show page ""two""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#popup"" data-role=""button"" data-rel=""dialog"" data-transition=""pop""&gt;Show page ""popup"" (as a dialog)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /content --&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""footer"" data-theme=""d""&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Page Footer&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /footer --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /page one --&gt;


&lt;!-- Start of second page: #two --&gt;
&lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""two"" data-theme=""a""&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""header""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Two&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /header --&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""content"" data-theme=""a""&gt;    
        &lt;h2&gt;Two&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have an id of ""two"" on my page container. I'm the second page container in this multi-page template.&lt;/p&gt;   
        &lt;p&gt;Notice that the theme is different for this page because we've added a few &lt;code&gt;data-theme&lt;/code&gt; swatch assigments here to show off how flexible it is. You can add any content or widget to these pages, but we're keeping these simple.&lt;/p&gt;  
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#one"" data-direction=""reverse"" data-role=""button"" data-theme=""b""&gt;Back to page ""one""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /content --&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""footer""&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Page Footer&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /footer --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /page two --&gt;


&lt;!-- Start of third page: #popup --&gt;
&lt;div data-role=""page"" id=""popup""&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""header"" data-theme=""e""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Dialog&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""content"" data-theme=""d""&gt;    
        &lt;h2&gt;Popup&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have an id of ""popup"" on my page container and only look like a dialog because the link to me had a &lt;code&gt;data-rel=""dialog""&lt;/code&gt; attribute which gives me this inset look and a &lt;code&gt;data-transition=""pop""&lt;/code&gt; attribute to change the transition to pop. Without this, I'd be styled as a normal page.&lt;/p&gt;      
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#one"" data-rel=""back"" data-role=""button"" data-inline=""true"" data-icon=""back""&gt;Back to page ""one""&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /content --&gt;

    &lt;div data-role=""footer""&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Page Footer&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /footer --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /page popup --&gt;

The problem is that when clicking on the link of the github site I do not see the files of my website but instead,I read what is written in the master branch's README.MD file which is only the title of my repository. I want to change that .I wish the files of my folder be displayed starting by the file of the main web page.
So my question is how I can change the publishing source of my repository in order for my folder's files be displayed? Is it possible to do that?
Thank you.
I am sorry I have found the way of uploading the screenshots for better explaining my problem in stackoverflow.</p>

<p>I'd like them to share a common set of jekyll files so it's easier to change themes, info, etc.. Has anyone managed to do this? Using subtree / submodule isn't too helpful because you cannot overwrite the <strong>source</strong> config option to change the location of the jekyll source files. Github Pages always forces the <strong>source</strong> to be in the root directory. You can change where <strong>_includes</strong> and <strong>_layouts</strong> reside but that's not too useful. Any advice or examples?</p>

<p>If you click on the links above you will find that they are pointing to the same file.</p>

<p>But, when I am trying to get the json file from localhost, with angularjs's $http.get, 1st url is giving a cross origin error, but the 2nd one is working just fine. i.e</p>

<p><strong>This DOES NOT WORK</strong></p>

<pre><code>.controller('mainCtrl', ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http){
    $http.get('http://codotronix.github.io/bengali-recipes/data/recipe-list.json')
    .then(function(res){

<p>It gives this error -></p>

<p><strong>But, This One Works</strong></p>

<p>And this time our <code>console.log</code> gives the expected output <code>Object {data: Array[19], status: 200, config: Object, statusText: ""OK""}</code></p>

<p>I have not set any Access-Control-Header anywhere. So, someone please explain to me why the 1st one is not working but the 2nd one is...</p>

<p>(Is this due to some sort of security mechanism that github has put in place? Just guessing...)</p>

<p>We found out a simple way to explain to new users how to setup their maven projects but we also need to explain it to people using ant (on Android, ant is the most common build tool).

Through the command &quot;hugo server&quot; I can view the website locally where everything looks fine.

<p>hugo compiles the project into a static website in the folder &quot;public&quot; [3].</p>

For example I am thinking about working with 3 repositories [1-3] marked above.

This way I would have to build the site manually on my local computer.</p>

<li>Don't want to build out a service to handle the webhook post, checkout from master, and check into gh-pages.</li>

I'm updating the content with ajax and use pushState/popstate for url updating and browser history. The problem is that if one <em>refreshes</em> the page at e.g. user.github.io/content1, the page is not found (because the html file doesn't actually exist). </p>

<p>I read that if one controls the server, this is usually solved by redirecting (or mod_rewrite-ing) every requested deep link to one resource and from there reconstructing the page with javascript according to the requested link. On gh-pages, this is not possible, so I thought about actually creating all the html files reflecting the url paths, but with each of them only containing the javascript code to re-generate the corresponding state (so that e.g. if I want to update my title or the links in the navbar, I don't have to manually edit all of the html files).  </p>

<p>I have read about Jekyll, but I'm a beginner and I'd like to program everything from scratch to learn something.</p>

It offers much more features such as <code>LaTeX</code> support, spreadsheet-like table support , outline view etc.</p>

<p>I like github pages because it supports <code>jekyll</code> based static sites. So I don't have to generate/publish my blog posts from <code>markdown</code>/<code>org-mode</code> into <code>html</code>. I also don't have to maintain two version controlled repositories : one is generated static html/css for github pages, the other is the markdown/org-mode source. </p>

<p>Currently, even though github does <a href=""https://github.com/github/markup"">support org-mode</a> source through <code>org-ruby</code>, github pages doesn't.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if there is a way to make github pages support <code>org-mode</code> natively, possibly through the same <code>org-ruby</code>, so that I can just have one <code>jekyll</code> based github pages repository, and author blogs in org-mode in it without publishing/generating htmls, just like I can in <code>markdown</code>.</p>

<p>So the problem is obvious. I never tried to modify other files except for social-media.yml. At first, at email part, it said url : &quot;mailto:&quot; but I misunderstood how to change that part and I fixed it with my email. However, I realized that is for url so I tried to fix with every way include &quot;mailto:&quot; but now every deployment cause an error 400. What should I do?</p>

If I run <code>yarn start</code> in my local copy of the app's top-level directory, it works exactly as expected, so there's nothing wrong with the app itself - the problem is in however Github Pages is running it. What do I need to tweak to get it to run properly?</p>

There are two github repositories involved: &quot;DOCS&quot; for the <em>staging</em> version of the website (dev.docs.com) and &quot;DOCS-PRODUCTION&quot; for hosting the <em>production</em> version (docs.com). All the &quot;magic&quot; happens in &quot;DOCS&quot; repository, devs clone it, push, pull, etc. When it's ready for a 'release', the idea is to do <code>git push production main</code> and have the latest version live.</p>
<p><strong>However, some (configuration) files need to be different for staging (&quot;DOCS&quot; repo) and production (&quot;DOCS-PRODUCTION&quot;) versions of the website. How to achieve this?</strong></p>

<li><code>git add remote production &lt;DOCS-PRODUCTION URL&gt;</code></li>

I'll be doing my best to describe this problem and make it easiest to answer.</p>

<p>I've made a Blazor project in Visual Studio and this is connected to the GitHub repository <a href=""https://github.com/willthamic/ChargeLearning"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> in the gh-pages branch. After reading Blazor's hosting and deploying guide <a href=""https://blazor.net/docs/host-and-deploy/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, I published the project in Visual Studio and copied the files in the <code>/bin/Release/netstandard2.0/publish/ChargeLearning/dist</code> folder to the root of the repository resulting in a repository with this file structure:</p>

<pre><code>ChargeLearning
    ChargeLearning
    _content
    _framework
    css
    sample-data
    ChargeLearning.sln
    index.html
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I think am already neck-deep in bad practice.</p>

<p>Regardless, attempting to load the <a href=""http://willhamic.com/ChargeLearning/"" rel=""noreferrer"">index.html</a> results in 404 errors in the console for most of the files in the html header like bootstrap (as the blazor deploying guide warned).</p>

<p>So I followed the instructions there as best as I could, attempting to implement <a href=""http://spa-github-pages.rafrex.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> single page app (SPA) fix for gh-pages linked in the guide.</p>

<p>I added the 404.html file to the ChargeLearning repository now when I load the page it displays just one 404 error, for the <code>blazor.webassembly.js</code> file. </p>

<p>I then add the redirect script from the SPA fix to my <code>willthamic.github.io</code> <a href=""https://github.com/willthamic/willthamic.github.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">repository</a> which when I open the <a href=""http://willhamic.com/ChargeLearning/_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">direct url</a> to the <code>blazor.webassembly.js</code> file seems to redirect properly but github shows my home page and I now realize that it has been severely mangled and now images aren't loading.</p>

<p>I feel like I am doing a lot of things wrong here which makes it difficult to isolate and solve a single problem at once. </p>

<p>If you have specific advice on how to properly deploy this or even small things on how to do what I'm trying to do a little more properly I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Properly loaded images are obtained by GET sent to this address: <code>https://3hdw.github.io/zpi-frontend/assets/fileName</code>

<p>I noticed this behaviour after updating my angular project.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Not loaded images are specified with css:   <code>background-image: url(""/assets/fileName"");</code><br/>
Loaded images are specified with html: <code>&lt;img src=""assets/fileName""/&gt;

<p>When serving my multi-page html website, I get a <code>404 - Not Found</code> every time I click on an <code>&lt;a href=""/""&gt;</code> link on my pages. Instead of redirecting to <code>https://mepley.github.io/github-pages-redirect-to-index/</code> where index.html is found, I am instead redirected to <code>https://mepley.github.io/</code> and thus I get the <code>404 - Not Found</code> message.</p>

<p><strong>Here is a link to a github pages site to demonstrate the issue (served from <code>master</code> branch):</strong>
<a href=""https://mepley.github.io/github-pages-redirect-to-index/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://mepley.github.io/github-pages-redirect-to-index/</a></p>

<p>My end goal is to simply use <code>&lt;a href=""/""&gt;</code> from another html document and redirect back to index.html. <strong>IMPORTANT: I DO NOT</strong> want to settle for any other strategy, such as <code>&lt;a href=""/index.html""&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a href=""./""&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a href=""../""&gt;</code> as relative references.</p>

<p>The reason I'm adamant about using just <code>""/""</code> is because I'm creating a boilerplate webpack configuration for building static websites for first-time, beginning coders to deploy a simple website to github pages and I'd prefer not having to explain this idiosyncrasy to people who are just learning and are already confused to begin with. </p>

<p>I've tried using <code>&lt;base href=""https://mepley.github.io/github-pages-redirect-to-index""&gt;</code> tags, but this did not fix the issue. I tried other <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tags as well, to no avail <em>(but maybe I did something wrong?)</em>. And as explained in my comment below I also know that relative references from the current page (i.e. <code>&lt;a href=""../""&gt;</code>) will in fact redirect to the correct homepage, but it still <strong>DOES NOT</strong> answer my question, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here are the only two files needed to demonstrate this issue:</p>

<p>index.html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    This is index.html
    &lt;a href=""./another-page.html""&gt;goto another-page.html&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>another-page.html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    This is another-page.html
    &lt;a href=""/""&gt;go back to index.html&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Expected result is that I click on the <code>&lt;a href=""/""&gt;</code> link in <code>another-page.html</code> and it redirects me back to <code>https://mepley.github.io/github-pages-redirect-to-index/</code> and finds <code>index.html</code> instead of <code>https://mepley.github.io/</code> with the 404 error as is currently happening.</p>

<p>Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Now, I have another html in ""mythmls/myhtml.html"" in the same repository. How to include this html in ""learn.html"" so that when I click the link it will RENDER the html of ""myhthml.html"" file not just show the SOURCE CODE?</p>

<p><strong>Attempt1</strong><br>
Inside the username.github.io/learn.html I added the following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>                    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=""Learn""&gt;Leetcode&lt;/h2&gt;
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhishanpdl/bhishanpdl.github.io/master/leetcode/lc_977.html""&gt;lc977&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I click this link, it gives me raw html source code, not the rendered version of HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Attempt2</strong>  </p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>               &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;iframe src=""lc_955.html"" name=""targetframe"" allowTransparency=""true"" scrolling=""yes"" frameborder=""0"" &gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives empty box with 404 ERRROR at the top right corner.</p>

<p>I am very new to HTML and this is the file I am <a href=""https://github.com/bhishanpdl/bhishanpdl.github.io/blob/master/learn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trying to edit</a>.</p>

<p>Do we have to create a new tab for each new html files?</p>

<p>Can we create just one tab and put some links there so that when we click that link it will RENDER the html (not show the SOURCE CODE) ?</p>
